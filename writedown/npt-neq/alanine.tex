\section{Introduction}


The possible effect of the electric field (EF) on the conformation of
proteins is a subject of increasing attention since it is linked to the problem of exposing human tissues to
electromagnetic radiation. Despite its major relevance, a
satisfactory understanding of how the EF influences the behaviour of proteins
has not been reached so far although a considerable number of
experimental e.g.~\cite{bohr2000microwave, bohr2000microwave-1,
  dePomerai2000cell, inskip2001cellular, mancinelli2004non} and
theoretical e.g.~\cite{budi2005electric, budi2007effect,
  budi2008comparative, toschi2008effects, astrakas2011electric,
  astrakas2012structural, damm2012can, starzyk2013proteins,
  english2009nonequilibrium, solomentsev2012effects}
studies have been devoted to this topic.

In this perspective, molecular dynamics (MD) has been proven useful in
understanding the behavior of a protein 
in both static and oscillatory EF~\cite{budi2005electric, budi2007effect, budi2008comparative,
  toschi2008effects, astrakas2011electric, astrakas2012structural,
  damm2012can, starzyk2013proteins, english2009nonequilibrium,
  solomentsev2012effects}. In these studies, the initial
configurations are usually taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB),
and then temperature controlled simulations are performed for a maximum
time range of the order of 10-60 nanoseconds.
During this simulation time 
relevant conformational changes characterizing the solvated molecule can be observed. 
Along the trajectories, various observable, such as the
secondary structure, root mean square displacement (RMSD), the dipole
moment, shape parameters are calculated as a function of time, or
in stationary condition, taking time averages.
This approach releases useful information on how the
secondary structure of the molecule is changed by external  EF.  However,
the behavior of observables in time is characterized by 
strong
fluctuations. The entity of the fluctuations is such that a quantitative 
analysis becomes difficult and does not allow for  a clear understanding of the rationale behind the conformational changes.
A time average can reduce the statistical uncertainty,
but in non-stationary conditions, it is a not-well-founded procedure.
In fact, we are studying non-stationary nonequilibrium process
(e.g. relaxing process to the new conformations under a static
EF, or the dynamics from one conformation to the other under an oscillatory EF).
In this perspective, if one wants to use MD, the proper way to do it would be that of treating a situation of nonequilibrium with algorithms that can explicitly describe it.
This is the approach that will be followed in this work, using
the dynamical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation (D-NEMD).
The method, firstly developed by one of us and coworkers~\cite{ciccotti1975direct, ciccotti1979thought, ciccotti1993theoretical, palla2008bulk}, 
has been recently applied, to the study of
hydrodynamics~\cite{orlandini2011hydrodynamics,
  orlandini2011hydrodynamics-01}. The essential feature of D-NEMD is to
provide a way of evaluating time-dependent
nonequilibrium averages starting from a properly determined initial ensemble.
In this context, the method can be used to analyze the
conformational changes of a solvated molecule, subject to a time-dependent EF.
In the present paper, we study a small peptide, alanine dipeptide, as a model for showing how the method can be used. 
The choice of a small peptide, rather than a larger one, is done firstly because it
is easier to draw clear conclusions on the nonequilibrium properties
of a single peptide by excluding the slow-going interplay between
different peptide segments along a chain.
Secondly, the computational cost required is rather massive and thus  testing
the various methodology proposed here would be hampered for large molecules,
although they \bluec{remain (\textit{does Giovanni write ``remain''? I cannot read})} our goal.

The paper is organized as follows:

simulations, we are able to address
a few relavant questions: (i)~How the conformation of the peptide
changes in an EF (conformational space);
(ii)~When do these changes happen (time scale),
and how likely they are (probability). 
To our knowledge, this study is one of the few (if not the first)  where
time-dependent nonequilibrium w.r.t. conformation
is explicitly considered for a \bluec{large molecule \textit{what does Giovanni write here? For me, the alanine dipeptide molecule is NOT large at all!}}
in solution subject to time-dependent EF.



\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation}
In this section we briefly review the dynamical approach to nonequilibrium
molecular dynamics (D-NEMD) \cite{ciccotti1975direct, ciccotti1979thought,
  orlandini2011hydrodynamics, orlandini2011hydrodynamics-01}.
In the following we denote the macroscopic observable by $O(t)$. If at $t$
the configurational probability distribution is $\rho(\vect x, t)$, where
$\vect x$ is the phase space variable, then the observable can be
expressed by
\begin{align}\label{eqn:tmp1}
  O(t) = \int d\vect x\, \hat O(\vect x)\rho(\vect x, t)  = \langle \hat O(\vect x), \rho(\vect x, t)\rangle,
\end{align}
we refer to $\hat O (\vect x)$ as the microscopic observable, 
which is measured at each point in the phase space $\vect x$.
Here we always assume that the initial probability distribution
$\rho(\vect x, 0)$ is known. In particular, in our case,
it is identical to the equilibrium distribution of the system
without EF.
The bracket on the right hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eqn:tmp1} denotes, as usual, the inner product in the
phase space.  We assume that he dynamics of the system is governed by the
Hamiltonian equation, i.e. $\dot {\vect x} = J \cdot \nabla_{\vect x}
\mathcal H(\vect x, t)$, where $\mathcal H$ is the time-dependent Hamiltonian,
and $J$ is
the symplectic matrix. The Liouville equation for the probability
distribution writes:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:tmp2}
  \frac{\partial \rho(\vect x, t)}{\partial t} = - iL(t) \rho(\vect x, t),
\end{align}
where $iL(t) = \{\cdot, \mathcal H\}$ is the Liouville operator.
Eq.~\eqref{eqn:tmp2}
can be formally solved by $\rho(\vect x, t) = U^\dagger(t,0) \rho(\vect x, 0)$,
where $U^\dagger(t,0) = \exp\{-i \int_0^t d t' L(t')\}$.
On the other hand
\begin{align}
  \frac{d \hat O(\vect x(t))}{dt} = \nabla_{\vect x}\hat O\cdot \dot{\vect x}
  = \nabla_{\vect x}\hat O\cdot J\cdot \nabla_{\vect x}\mathcal H
  = iL(t) \hat O (\vect x(t))
\end{align}
This equation can be formally solved by
$\hat O(\vect x(t)) = U(t,0)\,\hat O(\vect x(0))$, therefore,
\begin{align}\nonumber
  O(t) & = \langle \hat O(\vect x), \rho(\vect x, t)\rangle
  = \langle \hat O(\vect x), U^\dagger(t,0)\, \rho(\vect x, 0)\rangle
  = \langle U(t,0)\,\hat O(\vect x), \rho(\vect x, 0)\rangle\\\label{eqn:tmp4}
  &= \langle \hat O(\vect x(t)), \rho(\vect x, 0)\rangle
\end{align}
Since we assume that the system starts from the distribution of equilibrium (without EF)
 Eq.~\eqref{eqn:tmp4} expresses the fact that the 
observable $O(t)$ calculated in a situation of nonequilibrium is equal to the ensemble average of
the microscopic observable computed along trajectories, starting from
initial configurations sampled from an \emph{equilibrium}
distribution. In practical terms we proceed by first running an equilibrium MD simulation
to generate a sample of configurations. Next we employ these configurations as
initial configurations and, for each, the full Hamiltonian dynamics is integrated until
time $t$.
In this paper, these trajectories are called \emph{branching
  trajectories} (see Fig.\ref{branching} for a pictorial representation). 
Finally, the value of the macroscopic observable at time $t$ is
calculated by averaging the microscopic observable measured at each time $t$ along each branching trajectory.
Stochastic dynamics (e.g.~Langevin dynamics) can be handled analogoursly.

%Being more generalized, if the microscopic observable depends not only on the end
%configuration at time $t$, but also on the historical
%configurations along the trajectory, then expression~\eqref{eqn:tmp4} takes the generalized form:
%\begin{align}
%  O(t) = \int d\vect x\,\rho(\vect x, 0) \int_{\mathcal C\{\vect x, 0; t\}} \hat O[\vect x_s] \,d\mathcal P[\vect x_s] 
%\end{align}
%where the microscopic observable $ \hat O[\vect x_s] $ is now a
%functional of the trajectory.  $\mathcal C\{\vect x, 0; t\}$ is the
%set of all continuous trajectories starting at point $\vect x$ at time
%0, and ending at time $t$. $\mathcal P[\vect x_s] $ is the measure of
%the trajectory space $\mathcal C$.  In our case, it is the
%$\delta$-function peaked around the trajectories governed by the
%Hamiltonian dynamics. To be general, it can also be the measure of all
%trajectories generated by, for example, a Langevin dynamics, then the
%branching trajectories should be generated by the Langevin
%dynamics rather than the Hamiltonian dynamics.

% In practice, 
% Therefore, we are interested in a 
For this study, we are interested in 
nonthermal~\cite{delaHoz2005microwaves} effects of the EF
on the configuration of the solvated alanine dipeptide.
For this reason a proper control of the temperature in a nonequilibrium system
becomes an important issue; in fact it was argued that  an
accurate control of the internal reaction temperature is essential to
perform reproducible experiments~\cite{damm2012can}.
A straightforward (and realistic) implementation of the temperature control consists in 
embedding the alanine into an infinitely large solvent environment, and 
the EF is only applied to the neighborhood of the alanine. In this case
any extra heat generated by the EF can be effectively
dispersed in the large solvent environment.
In this way one can identify the effect of the EF on the conformational space of the solvated molecule,
without the artifact that the surrounding solvent cannot release the additional energy of the EF.
However, in practice, in most of the cases the computational cost of having large solvent environment is rather massive if not prohibitive.
Therefore, it is of interest to substitute the infinitely large
solvent environment with a smaller affordable system and at the same time accurately reproduce the nonequilibrium
physical properties of interest.
In MD, for equilibrium situations, the solution is to couple
the system to an external thermostat, under which the desired ensemble
(canonical in this case) can be
sampled by simulating a finite size system with periodic boundary
conditions.
However, coupling the system to a thermostat for nonequilibrium situations is a more delicate issue.
In fact, since a thermostat is explicitly designed to bring the system into
thermal equilibrium,
the perturbation produced by the EF would be mostly adsorbed by the thermostat. This means that the physics of the original dynamics in presence of the EF
would be lost and the response to the perturbation would be unphysical.

%in general problematic, 
%because the dynamics  under thermostating is artificial designed,

% However, for a nonequilibrium system, the \emph{dynamics} properties
% will be distrubed by the thermostat, because the

% artificial designed to reach the equilibrium probability distribution.
% For a nonequilibrium simulation, simply couple the system
% to a thermostat may not be a good idea, because the \emph{dynamics}
% generated by the thermostat is artificial, and deviation from the
% Hamiltonian dynamics under investigation will introduce artificial
% a effects in the nonequilibrium observations.

In this section we propose a procedure to solve the problem: we
start observing that the dynamics without thermostat of the alanine, 
and the water molecules in the closer solvation shells, is
crucial to determine the response of the observable of interest
under the EF perturbation
(in this work, the observable is the conformational change of alanine).
Instead the detailed dynamics of
the water molecules far away is not of primary importance: the region beyond the first solvation shells plays mainly the role of a thermodynamic bath. 
Therefore, instead of simulating an infinitely
large system, we simulate our finite size system with periodic
boundary condition, and with the following characteristics:
(i)~The simulating region is divided in two
subregions, a spherical region around the alanine dipeptide of radius $R_{ex}$,
centered at the alpha-carbon. Here the dynamics is
not subject to a thermostat.
We refer to such subregion as \emph{the  dynamical
region}. (ii)~Beyond $R_{ex}$, the dynamics of the water molecules is coupled
to a Langevin thermostat.  This region is called \emph{the thermostated
region}. For technical convenience we
fix the position of the alpha-carbon in space, so that the alanine is always
located at the center of the simulation region (see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp2}).
In these conditions, the  dynamics is preserved in the dynamical region (where the properties of interest are observed), while 
possible artificial effects of the thermostating process in the outside region
are negligible due to the finite correlation
range of liquid water.
At the same time, the thermostated region works as a infinitely large
environment that effectively absorbs the extra heat produced by the EF.
The validity of the above
statement will be checked by a series of numerical tests where it is shown that
the response of observables in nonequilibrium (i.e. under the effect of the EF) does not depend on the size of the system
and on the size of the  dynamical subregion, provided that they are
reasonably large.

\section{Case I: Alanine dipeptide
  under a uniform  constant EF}

\subsection{System settings and simulation protocol}
The system is set up in a $2.7\times 2.7\times
2.7\, \textsf{nm}^3$ periodic simulation region, with one alanine dipeptide
described by the CHARMM27 force field, and dissolved in 644 TIP3P
water molecules.
%The EF exserts force $\vect F = q \vect E(t)$ on
%the partial charge $q$ in the system.
The size of the  dynamical region is $R_{ex} = 1.0$~nm.
All simulations are performed by a home-modified GROMACS 4.5~\cite{pronk2013gromacs}.
First, an equilibrium NVT simulation of
100~\textsf{ns} was performed with a Langevin thermostat (time-scale
$\tau_T = 0.5~\textsf{ps}$).  Along the trajectory, configurations were taken every
50~\textsf{ps} and we used 2000 initial configurations for each nonequilibrium
MD simulation (if not stated otherwise for specific cases).
% They server as starting point of the branching
% trajectories.
The branching trajectories were integrated by the
Leap-frog scheme with the aforementioned nonequilibrium
temperature control technique.  The
time step was $\Delta t = 0.002~\textsf{ps}$. The short-range
interaction was smoothed from $0.8$ to $1.0~\textsf{nm}$ by the
``switch'' method provided by Gromacs.  An energy conserving PME
method was applied to calculate the electrostatic interaction in this
periodic system. In the thermostated region, the original dynamics was
coupled to a Langevin thermostat with $\tau_T = 0.1~\textsf{ps}$.
The whole system is also coupled to a Parrinello-Rahman barostat~\cite{parrinello1981polymorphic} with $\tau_P = 2.0~\textsf{ps}$ to keep
the pressure at ambient condition (1~Bar). Since the
change of the system size is small and slow, the pressure control
does not have an sizeable effect on the
dynamics of the system.
At time $t=0$~ps, the system
has been fully equilibrated without any EF. From $t=0$ to
the warm-up time $t=t_{\textrm{warm}}$, the EF is switched on linearly, while
after $t=t_{\textrm{warm}}$, the field is kept constant in time at
$E_{\infty}$.  In this work we consider $t_{\textrm{warm}} = 10$~ps,
and $E_{\infty} = 1$~V/nm.
The direction of the field is arbitrarily chosen along the
$x$ direction.
In this paper we denote the
EF as a function of time $\vect E(t)$.
Therefore, for the case of constant EF, we have
$\vect E(t) = (E_\infty\cdot t/t_{warm},0,0)$ for $0\leq t < t_{warm}$, and 
$\vect E(t) = (E_\infty,0,0)$
for $t \geq t_{warm}$.

    The Ramachandran plots are divided into 5 subregions corresponding
    to 5 molecular conformations:
    $A_1 = \{(\phi, \psi) | -134 \leq \phi <  13, -125 \leq \psi < 74\}$,
    $A_2 = \{(\phi, \psi) |  128 \leq \phi <-134, -125 \leq \psi < 74\}$,

    $C   = \{(\phi, \psi) |   13 \leq \phi < 128, -180 \leq \psi < 180\}$.
    Considering the periodic bondary condition, if we write, for example,
    $128 \leq \phi <-134$, it means that $\phi$ is in either range
    $128 \leq \phi < 180$ or in $-180 \leq \phi < -134$.
    This division is the same for both plot (b) and (c).

investigated by estimate the probability density $p(\phi,\psi,t)$ on

The equilibrium probability density of

therefore, for the sake of clarity, we divide the
Ramachandran histogram into 5 subregions $\{A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C\}$
(see the caption of Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp4} for definition), and
call each subregion, in short, a conformation of the alanine dipeptide. 
These conformations
are found in different secondary structures of a peptide chain:
$A_1$ and $A_2$ are
corresponding to the $\alpha$-helix. $B_1$ and $B_2$ are
corresponding to the $\beta$-sheet. $C$ is corresponding to the
left-handed $\alpha$-helix.
}
% In the end,
% the analysis of conformations on the Ramachandran plot is
% reduced to the analysis of the 5 conformations.


From Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp4}, it is obvious that the probability of
conformations changes when the external EF is applied.
For instance, the probability of conformation $C$ vanishes in equilibrium,
but plays an important role when the EF is applied. We
therefore want to study how the alanine changes from one conformation
to the other, how fast the change is, and the relations to the 
the EF. 
Firstly, we calculate the probability
of each conformation:
\begin{align}
  P_I(t) = \mathbb P (\vect x_t \in I), \quad  I \in \{A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C\},
\end{align}
Notice that the probability is time dependent, being an observable in nonequilibrium situation.
% which is the time dependent probability of the alanine being in metastable
% state $I$.
% Secondly, we study the
% forward and backward transition probability of the metastable conformations, which is defined by
% \begin{align}
%   P^{\fwd}_{J,I}(t) & = \mathbb P( \vect x_{t+\Delta t} \in J | \vect x_t \in I) \\
%   P^{\bwd}_{J,I}(t) & = \mathbb P( \vect x_{t-\Delta t} \in J | \vect x_t \in I) 
%   % \qquad I, J \in \{A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C\},
% \end{align}
% where $\Delta t$ is the time-scale of the observation.
% For a revserible and homogeneous Markov process, it is easy to show
% that $P^{\fwd}_{J,I} = P^{\bwd}_{J,I}$, and both of them are time independent. For a general nonequilibrium
% process considered by the present work, this relation is genarlly not guarenteed.
Secondly,
we study the net probability flux from conformation $I$ to $J$, defined by:
\begin{align}\nonumber
  F_{J,I}(t) & = \frac1{\Delta t}\, [\mathbb P( \vect x_{t-\Delta t} \in J, \vect x_t \in I) - \mathbb P( \vect x_{t-\Delta t} \in I, \vect x_t \in J)], \\\label{eqn:tmp7}
  & J,I \in \{A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C\}.
\end{align}
\recheck{Where $\mathbb P( \vect x_{t-\Delta t} \in J, \vect x_t \in I)$
is joint probability of the alanine being of conformation $J$ at
time $(t-\Delta t)$ \emph{and} being of conformation $I$ at time $t$.
A similar definition applies to $\mathbb P( \vect x_{t-\Delta t} \in I, \vect x_t \in J)$.}
Here the time interval $\Delta t$ should be small enough comparing with the
time scale of conformational dynamics,
so that the changes in the conformation probabilities
can be linearly approximated.
In the meanwhile,  $\Delta t$ should also be  large enough comparing with
the timestep of MD integrator, 
so that the left hand of Eq.~\eqref{eqn:tmp7} is well-defined, and can be
estimated with good statistical accuracy.
See also the discussions in Ref.~\cite{schuette2011markov}.
% \recheck{$F_{J,I}(t)$ is essentially the time-dependent rate of
%   conformation change from $J$ to $I$.}
A positive value \recheck{of $F_{J,I}(t)$} indicates the
net flux from $J$ to $I$,
while a negative value indicates a net flux from $I$ to $J$.
Through $F_{J,I}(t)$, the original overall nonequilibrium process $\vect x_t$
is reduced to the probabilistic link between discretized conformations $\{A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C\}$.
% If the resulting reduced process

In the case of oscillatory EF, the net probability flux is also highly oscillatory,
thus it is convenient to study the integrated net probability flux:

The time-dependent probability density of \bluec{the system \textit{what does Giovanni add here?} in} a certain
conformation is given in
Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp5}. The $\beta$-sheet conformations $B_1$ and $B_2$,
which are present at the initial stage after EF is switched on,
fade away as the system relaxes to the new equilibrium. The
probability of the $\alpha$-helix conformation $A_1$, grows from 0.45 to 0.69.
The $\alpha$-helix $A_2$  does not change significantly  under the action of EF.
The left-hand helix conformation $C$ noticeably grows from 0 to 0.22.
We plot the net probability fluxes and their integration in Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp6}.
Results show that for short $t$, the net fluxes are generally non-zero, however, 
as $t$ goes to infinity,
all fluxes converge to zero. This indicates
that as the EF is switched on, the system first is driven away from the initial
equilibrium (at zero EF);  This is a nonequilibrium process.
After a long enough time, the system
is fully relaxed to the new equilibrium defined by the action of the constant EF,
and stays there as long as the EF is kept.

% Even though the system is finally relaxed to the new equilibrium,
% the timescale of relaxation of each conformation is different. 
% From Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp6}, we observe mainly
% three different timescales, as summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:tmp1}.
% (1) From
% $t=0$ to approximately 10~\textsf{ps}, a net flux from 
% $A_1$ to $A_2$ establishes.
% A similar flux is also observed from $B_1$ to $B_2$.
% Afterwards, these two fluxes vanish and are finally reversed,
% i.e. $A_2$ to $A_1$ and $B_2$ to $B_1$, respectively.
% % the population of $A_1$ firstly decreases and then increases to the original value,
% % while the population of $A_2$ increases sharply. The plot of the net probability flux shows that 
% % there is firstly a fast probability flux (conformational change) from
% % $A_1$ to $A_2$, and then follows a probability flux with the same maganitude in the opposite direction, i.e.  from
% % $A_2$ to $A_1$.
% Moreover, a net flux from all $\beta$-sheet conformations
% ($B_1$ and $B_2$) into $\alpha$-helix conformations ($A_1$, $A_2$ and
% $C$) has been established.
% % Also in this time-scale, strong and increasing probability flux from $B_2$ to $B_1$ is observed from Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp6}.
% % The population of $B_1$ remains almost unchanged,
% % because it  at the same time loses population to $\alpha$-helix conformations.
% % Since  $B_2$ conformations not only changes into $B_1$, but also into $\alpha$-helix conformations, we observe a charp
% % decrease of $B_2$ population between 10 and 20~ps.
% (2), From $t=10$ to
% 100~\textsf{ps},
% The net flux from  conformation $A_2$ to $A_1$ and from $B_2$ to $B_1$
% gradually decays to 0. Conformational changes from $B_2$ to $A_1$, $A_2$ and $C$
% vanishes in about 50~ps.
% % The net flux from $B_1$  to $A_1$ and $C$ decay slower and 
% % will be discussed later.
% At this stage, the probability of $B_2$ decreases to almost 0,
% while the probability of $A_2$
% converge to a non-vanishing value of approximately 0.06.
% % the population of $B_2$ decreases by 0.15, and this
% % configuration almost disappears. Interestingly, the population of $A_1$
% % increases by the same amount, and the population of $A_2$ goes back to
% % the initial value. The populations of $B_1$ and $C$ start increasing
% % and decreasing, correspondingly. The speed of these changes are much
% % slower than that of $B_2$ and $A_1$.
% (3) At the time scale of $
% 500~\textsf{ps}$, the population of $A_1$, $B_1$ and $C$ converge to
% the new equilibrium (system with $E(\infty) = 1~\textsf{V/m}$).
% We observe a decaying probability flux from $B_1$ 
% to $A_1$ and $C$.
% The magnitude of the flux from $B_1$ to  $C$ is larger than that of $B_1$ to  $A_1$.
% % It is interesting to see that at nonequilibrium steady state, $A_1$ exchange
% % population with $A_2$, and $B_1$ exchange
% % population with $B_2$. However, when the $C$ conformation hardly changes
% % to any other conformation, as indicated by the almost 1 value of the forward
% % transition probability of set $C$. This implies that at the left-handed $\alpha$-helix is
% % acutally more stable than  other conformations.
% This time-scale is actually 50 times slower than that, at which
% the EF was switched on ($t_{\textrm{warm}} = 10~\textsf{ps}$).

% After aligning to the external EF, the alanine slowly adjust its conformation,
% and the new equilibrium is reached at slower time scales.

% To further test the dynamics of metastable population, two simulations
% of $t_{\textrm{warm}} = 100~\textsf{ps}$ and $t_{\textrm{warm}} =
% 500~\textsf{ps}$ are performed. The first time scale of $t =
% 20~\textsf{ps}$ disappears in both of the testing simulations. In the
% simulation of $t_{\textrm{warm}} = 100~\textsf{ps}$, the population of
% $A$, $B_1$ and $C$ converges to the non-equilibrium steady state at
% around $500~\textsf{ps}$. This further verifies internal time scale of
% $A_1$, $B_1$ and $C$ presented in the testing case of
% $t_{\textrm{warm}} = 10~\textsf{ps}$.  The dynamics of $B_2$ is
% faster: it decays to zero as soon as the external EF is fully
% switched on. In the case of $t_{\textrm{warm}} = 500~\textsf{ps}$, the
% growth of the external EF is comparable to the longest
% internal time scale of system, which means that the changes of the
% perturbation to the system is so slow that the system can catch up, so
% the process can be treated as  quasi-equilibrium.
% The numerical results show the same story: the relaxation
% of all populations are around $500 \sim 600~\textsf{ps}$.

\redc{The dipole momenet of alanine dipeptide is defined by

where $q_i$ denotes the partial charge of an atom $i$ on the alanine,
and the molecule is neutral, i.e.~$\sum_iq_i = 0$.
$\vect r_i$ denotes the position of the atom $i$.}
Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp3}
shows that the $x$-component of the dipole moment 
reaches 85\% of the maximum value in only 20~ps, which is comparable to
the warm-up time $t_{warm}$, and is 25 times
smaller than the slowest time scale of the conformational relaxation.
Then in the following 400~ps, the dipole slowly relaxes to the 
maximum value, that is, 
6.8~Debye, and  corresponds to a dipole energy
\redc{$\boldsymbol\mu_{\textrm{alanine}} \cdot \vect E$}
of c.a.~$-13.6$~kJ/mol.
We calculate the averaged dipole moment of different conformations
\redc{(defined by taking averge in Eqn.~\eqref{eqn:tmp8}
only for a certain conformation)}
under the constant EF, and they are 6.8, 6.0, 5.1, 3.1 and 7.1~Debye
for $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1$, $B_2$ and $C$, respectively.
The dipole energy difference between 3.1 and 7.1~Debye is roughly 8.0~kJ/mol.
\recheck{NOTE by Han: \textit{
    I removed the discussion of the free energy barrier.}}
% The free energy barriers between the
% conformations were reported to be of order $20\sim 40$~kJ/mol~\cite{bohner2012algorithm},
% which is comparable to the dipole energy difference. 
Therefore, under a constant EF, the system will be driven towards those
conformations with higher dipole moment, because the
energy of the system will be lowered.  This is the reason why
we observe that the $\beta$-sheet conformations with lower dipole moment
are driven towards $\alpha$-helix conformations, 
and $A_1$ and $C$ are conformations with higher probability, because their dipole moments are the highest
among all conformations. Moreover, the $B_2$ conformation vanishes because
its dipole is significantly lower than other conformations.
% This also explains the two-time scale behavior of the molecular dipole
% moment.
From 0 to 20~ps, the probability of
lowest dipole conformation $B_2$ quickly
vanishes. We observe a sharp increment of the average molecular dipole and finally, approaching  500~ps, the conformation slowly migrates from
$B_1$ to $A_1$ and $C$. Moreover, since the dipole moment $A_1$ and $C$
is higher than $B_1$, the average molecular dipole moment slowly increases
to the nonequilibrium steady value.


\subsection{Response of the orientational order parameter}

Let us define
the geometric direction of the alanine by the red vector in
Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp3}, i.e.~by the angle bisector of the two black vectors,
which connect the $\alpha$-carbon and the carbons
on the methyl groups. 
We considered the angle $\theta$ made by 
the orientation of the alanine dipeptide in space w.r.t.~the direction of EF
as a function of time.
Then we defined the orientational order parameter 
\begin{align}
  S_\theta = \langle 3\sin^2\theta - 2\rangle,
\end{align}
The ensemble average is taken over the trajectory ensemble, so it is
a time dependent observable.
The order parameter
indicates where lies \bluec{in time average \textit{(is it correct?)}} the molecule w.r.t.~the EF.
If the molecule is perfectly perpendicular to the EF, then $S_\theta = 1$.
If the molecule has no directional
preference, then $S_\theta = 0$. \bluec{\textit{What does Giovanni's comment mean here?}}
If the molecule lies perfectly parallel to the EF, then $S_\theta = -2$.
From $t=0$ to roughly 10~ps, the orientational order parameter rapidly
decreases from 0 to $-0.15$, which means a weak alignment of the molecule to the external field.
Then from $t=0$ to 500~ps, the molecule slowly changes to the orientation
that is perpendicular to the EF. \bluec{\textit{I do not know how to explain here...}}
This orientational change is linked to the observed slowest
time scale of the molecular conformational change.


\subsection{Effects of EF on the solvent around the molecule}
% This indicate that when the EF is switched on, the alanine almost immediately
% changes its conformation so that the molecular dipole is aligned to the
% external EF.
% align itself to the
% direction of the external EF without much conformational change.
% And then, the conformation is slowly adjusted according to the
% external field (now it is the same as the molecular dipole),
% finally  the new equilibrium is reached at a much slower time scale
% (approximately 500~ps).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% solvent effect
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We study the solvent effect on the alanine dipeptide in the presence of the EF by investigating
the radial distribution function (RDF) between $\alpha$-carbon and the
center-of-mass (COM) of the water molecules
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp7a}). The average
RDF does not change significantly as a function of time
(within the statistical error). 
Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp7a}~(b) presents the number of hydrogen bonds between the
alanine and water molecules, and between two water molecules.
\recheck{The hydrogen bonds are calculated by standard GROMACS
routine {\texttt {g\_hbond}}, with donor-acceptor distance cut-off 0.3~nm,
and hydrogen-donor-acceptor angle cut-off $20^{\circ}$.}
We see that the
number of hydrogen bonds remains almost the same as the EF is turned on,
although molecular dipoles tend to align with the direction of the EF (result
not shown). 
The EF-induced solvent effect on the alanine is also counted by calculating the
difference of the water-alanine electrostatic interaction 
without and with the EF.
The energy difference is found to be $-19.1$~~kJ/mol that is
comparable to the electrostatic energy associated to the dipole of the alanine itself.
Therefore, we conclude that the solvation structure around the
alanine does not change or contribute significantly in determining the conformational dynamics of the alanine under the action of EF.






\subsection{The finite-size effect on the dynamical and thermostated regions}

  \label{fig:tmp7}
\end{figure}

Just as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:tmp2b}, we performed nonequilibrium MD
simulations in a finite size periodic system, further divided it
into a dynamical and a thermostated region.
Since the periodic boundary conditions and the division of the system
are technical approximations to the real system with dynamics-preserving thermal control, 
the effect of the finite-size in 
the system settings should be carefully checked.
Therefore, we
perform two additional simulations: one with box dimensions
$L=4.0$~nm (the box is cubic) and a
Hamiltonian dynamical region of radius $R_{ex} = 1.0$~nm. A second simulation is done with box size $L=4.0$~nm and a dynamical region of
radius $R_{ex} = 1.5$~nm. We compare the results of these two simulations to those of the system we have used so far, i.e. $L=2.7$~nm and $R_{ex} = 1.0$~nm.
Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp7} shows essential consistency in
the simulation results for the three systems. The finite-size effects are
negligible.



\section{Case II:
  periodically oscillatory EF}
\bluec{\textit{what does he add besides the caption of the section?}}

A step forward in our study is to consider a periodically oscillatory EF which has
a $\sin$-wave shape:
\begin{align}
  \vect E(t) = (E_0\sin(2\pi t / T), 0, 0)
\end{align}
where $E_0$ is the intensity of the field, which is chosen to be
1.0~V/nm.  $T$ is the oscillating period.
Here we tested three different
periods 10, 40 and 200~ps.
% The periods of the later two are
% commensurate to the time scales discovered by the nonequilibrium MD
% simulation of constant EF. The first is to test the if the
% period is further reduced to smaller than 20~ps, there is any other
% timescale of interest would play a role. Although the periods are
% chosen according to the discovered time scales in the constant
% EF simulation, the nonequilibrium phenonema of oscillating
% EF cannot be derived from the constant field system.
% As far as the EF changes, the internal time scale of the
% system also changes, therefore, the nonequilibrium probabilities is a
% complicated interplay of different internal time scales under
% different EF.
% We do not try to theoretically predict

Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp8} (a)
presents the $x$-component of the molecular dipole moment as
a function of time. The red, green and blue lines report the
results of $T=10$~ps, 40~ps and 200~ps, respectively. The black line
shows the dipole moment under constant EF
for reference.
It shows that the oscillating period of the molecular dipole moment
is the same as the period of the oscillatory EF. Therefore,
the molecular dipole moment
is able to respond to the external EF almost immediately.
At $T=200$~ps, the maximum magnitude of the molecular
dipole moment is close to the values obtained in the case of constant EF, which
means that the variation of the oscillatory EF is so slow that the
alanine has enough time to 
relax its dipole. However,
for $T=10$ and 40~ps, the EF oscillates faster,
and although the alanine dipeptide can respond to the EF action immediately,
it does not have enough time to fully relax the dipole, as a consequence the maximum dipole moment is smaller than the previous case.
% For even smaller period $T=10$~ps, the alanine does not have enough
% time  to properly align the molecular dipole according to the external
% field, so we see the maximum dipole moment is only about one third of the
% constant EF case.
Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp9}~(b) presents the orientational order
parameter. The notations are the same as Fig~\ref{fig:tmp9}~(a).
% From the constant
% EF simulation, we see that the response of order parameter has
% two time scales: In the fast time scale, the 
For all cases the order parameter is much
smaller than in the case of constant EF. One possible reason is that the
relaxation of the order parameter is very slow, and the molecule in the case of oscillatory field is
not exposed to a strong enough EF for a long enough.
\bluec{\textit{I cannot read and understand Giovanni's comment referring here on the top of this page.}}
For  $T=10$ and 40~ps, the orientation of the alanine is only weakly
parallel to the EF. It is worth to notice that for constant EF,
we also observe a quick alignment of molecular orientation to the EF
on the time scale of 10~ps. For $T=200$~ps, the molecule periodically
becomes \recheck{weakly} perpendicular to the EF, but this directional preference is much
weaker than the case of constant EF.

\section{Conclusions and discussions}

We have investigated the conformational
dynamics of alanine dipeptide under the action of a constant and oscillatory electric
field (EF) by the dynamical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (D-NEMD) method.
The conformations of the alanine dipeptide are
firstly projected onto the Ramachandran plot, and
then grouped in 5  conformations.
% several conformations are identified by a manual
% division of the Ramachandran histogram.
These conformations
correspond to different secondary structures in larger molecules
(i.e.~proteins).
Next, the time-dependent probability
of being in a certain conformation and the net probability flux
between them are calculated.
\recheck{
  We demonstrated the reliablity
  of the local thermostating temperature control method
  by showing that the finite size effects of the
  dynamical region and the thermostated region are negligible.  
  From the results obtained, we found differnet time scales of
  conformational response with respect to both the constant  and
  oscillatory EF, and the probability flux net work established
  by the oscillatory EF. These phenonema can not be easily investigated
  by traditional equilibrium MD methods, therefore the effectiveness of
  the nonequilibrium MD method proposed by this paper
  is a powerful to study the truely nonequilibrium systems.
}


% From the results obtained, we conclude that under a constant EF, several different time scales
% of the conformational dynamics can be identified. The slowest time scale,
% in the range of 500~ps, corresponds to a conformational change
% from $B_1$ (corresponds to $\beta$-sheet) to $A_1$ and $C$ (right-handed
% and left handed $\alpha$-helix, respectively).
% Under the constant EF, the dipole moment of alanine aligns parallel to the direction of the EF, while the direction of the molecule lies perpendicular to the
% EF. Moreover, the dipole moment response of the alanine is
% shown to be much faster than the orientational response.
% The solvation structure around the alanine is investigated
% by calculating the solute-solvent radial distribution function and the average number of hydrogen
% bond, and is proved to be preserved as the EF is turned on, though the
% dipole moment of both solute and solvation molecules is aligned with the direction of the EF.
% Then, we consider three oscillatory EF cases with different frequency:
% 5, 25 and 100~GHz, respectively. The
% probability of conformations are observed to be also oscillatory,
% and the frequency of this oscillation is the same as the external EF.
% After long enough time,
% the system reaches a ``steady state'', and the probabilities oscillate only around
% a time-independent value at the long time scale. Notice that, strictly speaking, this is not a  true ``steady state'' as defined in
% literature~\cite{seifert2010fluctuation}, because at the
% short time scale, the probabilities are still oscillating (with a period that is the same as the EF).
% % they oscillate only around a time-invariant value,
% % so we say the system reaches a steady state.
% Although in a time-average process the EF vanishes, the probabilities of the conformations, as a matter of fact, changes due to the oscillatory EF. The most relevant phenomenon
% is the increasing probability of conformation $C$ that corresponds to
% the left-handed $\alpha$-helix.
% The slowest time scale of 25 and 100~GHz systems is about 300~ps, while
% that of the 5~GHz system is significantly higher: 1200~ps.
% We further update the last number to 3200~ps by analyzing the net probability flux.
% % We further present a updated slowest time scale of the  5~GHz system
% % to 3200~ps from the net probability flux.
% In comparison with the periods of the EF, these time scales are much
% slower, which indicate a very strong time scale separation
% in these nonequilibrium conformation dynamics.
% Although the time-average of the oscillatory EF vanishes, we observed a
% \emph{directional} net probability flux between the conformations, and several
% loop structures are observed. This result is unexpected and shed
% light on the phenomenon of nonequilibrium conformational circulations driven
% by oscillatory EF.

% To eliminate the thermal effect in the nonequilibrium process, 
% we propose  a nonequilibrium
% temperature control method, by which the Hamiltonian dynamics is kept
% around the molecule of interest, while the solvent far from the
% molecule is thermostated. We prove the effectiveness of this
% temperature control technique for nonequilibrium MD by testing
% the finite size effect of the Hamiltonian dynamics region and the
% thermostated region.

The intensity of the EF used in this paper is 1~V/nm for both constant
and oscillatory cases. This intensity is 4-5 orders of magnitude
higher than that reachable in a standard laboratory microwave
instrument~\cite{damm2012can}. However, this intensity is achievable
by a sharp electric field emitter tip~\cite{scovell2000phase}, near
the surface of mica~\cite{starzyk2013proteins}, or by a modern laser
equipment~\cite{vogel2008femtosecond}. The authors are fully aware
that the EF investigated in the present paper is idealized
\recheck{
  in the sence that the field is spacially homogenous and
  the time-dependency is well defined,} as pointed
out by previous simulation studies~\cite{budi2005electric,
  budi2007effect, budi2008comparative, toschi2008effects,
  astrakas2011electric, astrakas2012structural, damm2012can,
  starzyk2013proteins, english2009nonequilibrium,
  solomentsev2012effects}. However, the present work presents a way of
studying the EF induced conformational dynamics, and opens the
possibility of conformational manipulation of the protein by applying
an external EF.

To describe the system, we use a classical force field with TIP3P water model.
The EF is well know to be able to protonate the water molecule at the
intensity we used in the paper. However, this happens at the time
scale of femtoseconds, which is much shorter than the slowest time
scale resolved by the current research, so on average it should not play an essential role on the conformational dynamics.
The polarization w.r.t.~the external EF also does
not play a important role, because  under the EF of 1~V/nm, the induced dipole
of water is only c.a.~0.05~Debye that is negligible comparing with the
dipole moment response observed in our simulations.  Therefore, it is
reasonable to use a non-polarizable model in this study.  The reason we
prefer a rigid water model is that it is computationally more
efficient than any polarizable water model.  We also want to remind
the reader that it has been reported recently that the physical scale of the slowest
dynamics differs in a considerable way between different force
fields~\cite{vitalini2013speed}. However, the qualitative conclusions (for
example the answer to the question of which is the slowest and the second slowest process, from which
conformation to which conformation the system moves)
seem to be independent from the force field,
at least for the alanine dipeptide.

% are basically consistent for the alanine from the point of view of force fields.
