\section{Introduction}


The possible effect of the electric field (EF) on the conformation of
proteins gains increasing attantion recently, because it closly
related to the health problem of exposing human tissue in the
electromagnetic radiation. Despite the importance of this problem, a
complete understanding of how the electric field influnece the  protein
is still lacking, therefore, a conserderable number of
experimental~\cite{bohr2000microwave, bohr2000microwave-1,
  dePomerai2000cell, inskip2001cellular, mancinelli2004non} and
theoretical~\cite{budi2005electric, budi2007effect,
  budi2008comparative, toschi2008effects, astrakas2011electric,
  astrakas2012structural, damm2012can, starzyk2013proteins,
  english2009nonequilibrium, solomentsev2012effects} studies have been devoted to this topic,
and the references listed above is far from complete.

The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been proved to be useful in
understanding the behavior of a protein (or a short peptide segment)
in both static and oscillatory electiric
fields~\cite{budi2005electric, budi2007effect, budi2008comparative,
  toschi2008effects, astrakas2011electric, astrakas2012structural,
  damm2012can, starzyk2013proteins, english2009nonequilibrium,
  solomentsev2012effects}. In these studies, the initial
configurations are usually taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
And then the temperature controlled simulation are performed for from
a few to tens of nanoseconds, during which the interested
conformational chanages can be observed. Along the trajectories, the
secondary structure, root mean square displacement (RMSD), the dipole
moment and some shape parameters are calculated and investigated by
either plotted as a function of time, or doing time average over the
whole simulation. This approach release useful information on how the
secondary structure is changed by external electiric field.  However,
by plotting the quantities against time, one may observe strong
fluctuation in plots, which hintered the quantitative and conclusive
analysis on what is happening during the conformational change, when
it happens and what is the strength. Although the statistical
uncertainty in the time-averaged observations are small, the
time-average itself is not well defined for a nonequilibrium process
such as relaxing process to the new conformations under static
electiric field, and the dynamics under oscillating electric field.

The dynamical nonequilibrium molecular dyanmics simulation (D-NEMD)
was firstly developed by G. Ciccotti and his
colleagues~\cite{ciccotti1975direct, ciccotti1979thought}, and
recently successfully applied to the study of
hydrodynamics~\cite{orlandini2011hydrodynamics,
  orlandini2011hydrodynamics-01}. D-NEMD provides a way of evaluating
nonequilibrium observables by doing an ensemble of nonequilibrium MD
simualtions.  This provides a promising way of analysing the
conformational changing under a generally time-dependent electric
field. In the present paper, we study the minimal model peptide
segment -- alanine dipeptide. We take the approach of starting from a
single peptide rather than a more realistic chain, firstly because it
is easier to draw clear conclusions on the nonequilibrium properties
of a single peptide by excluding all possible interplay between
different peptide segments along a chain, then construct the chain
nonequilibrium properties from the well-studied single peptides.
Secondly, the current computationl resource available is not enought
to study peptide chains by D-NEMD, since one needs to simualte an
ensemble of MD trajectories (typically a few thousands), so it
requires much higher computational cost than producing a single MD
trajectory.

In this paper, we firstly describe the idea of the D-NEMD, then
observables helping us the analyze the nonequilibrium properties
(i.e., the dipole moment, time-dependent properties of being a certain
conformation, the nonequilibrium transition properties and the net
property flux) are introduced. The numerical results of alanine
dipeptide under static and sine-shaped oscillating electric field are
presented. By calculating the nonequilibrium properties from the D-NEMD
simulations, we are able to answer from which to which the conformation
changes, when do these changes happend, and how strong are the changes.
As far as we know, our simulation is the first D-NEMD simulation
on the electric field effect on alanine dipeptide, and provides new
information helping people better understand the nonequilibrium
effect of electric field on the protein conformation.



\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation}
Here we fastly review the approach of performing nonequilibrium
molecular dynamics that was initiated by Giovanni Ciccoti and his
colleagues~\cite{ciccotti1975direct, ciccotti1979thought,
  orlandini2011hydrodynamics, orlandini2011hydrodynamics-01}.
We denote the macroscopic nonequilibrium observable by $O(t)$. If at $t$
the configurational probability distribution is $\rho(\vect x, t)$, where
$\vect x$ is the phase space variable, then the observable can be
expressed by
\begin{align}\label{eqn:tmp1}
  O(t) = \int d\vect x\, \hat O(\vect x)\rho(\vect x, t)  = \langle \hat O(\vect x), \rho(\vect x, t)\rangle,
\end{align}
where $\hat O (\vect x)$ is the microscopic observable. Compared with
the macroscopic observable, it is measured at the phase space position $\vect x$.
The bracket on the right hand side denotes the inner produce in the
phase space.  We assume the dynamics of the system is governed by the
Hamiltonian equation, i.e. $\dot {\vect x} = J \cdot \nabla_{\vect x}
\mathcal H(\vect x)$, where $\mathcal H$ is the Hamiltonian and $J$ is
the symplectic matrix, then the Liouville equation of the probability
distribution is
\begin{align}\label{eqn:tmp2}
  \frac{\partial \rho(\vect x, t)}{\partial t} = - iL(t) \rho(\vect x, t),
\end{align}
where $iL(t) = \{\cdot, \mathcal H\}$ is the Liouville operator and
$\mathcal H$ is the Hamiltonian of the system. The Eq.~\eqref{eqn:tmp2}
can be formally solved by $\rho(\vect x, t) = e^{-iL(t)} \rho(\vect x, 0)$.
On the other hand
\begin{align}
  \frac{d \hat O(\vect x(t))}{dt} = \nabla_{\vect x}\hat O\cdot \dot{\vect x}
  = \nabla_{\vect x}\hat O\cdot J\cdot \nabla_{\vect x}\mathcal H
  = iL(t) \hat O (\vect x(t))
\end{align}
This equation can be formally solved by $\hat O(\vect x(t)) = e^{iL(t)} O(\vect x, 0)$, therefore,
\begin{align}\nonumber
  O(t) & = \langle \hat O(\vect x), \rho(\vect x, t)\rangle
  = \langle \hat O(\vect x), e^{-iL(t)} \rho(\vect x, 0)\rangle
  = \langle e^{iL(t)}\hat O(\vect x), \rho(\vect x, 0)\rangle\\\label{eqn:tmp4}
  &= \langle \hat O(\vect x(t)), \rho(\vect x, 0)\rangle
\end{align}
If the inital state of the system is in equilibrium, i.e. the initial
probability distribution is the equilibrium distribution. Then an
explicit translation of Eq.~\eqref{eqn:tmp4} is that the
nonequilibrium observable is equal to the ensenble average of
microscopic observable measured along trajectory $\vect x(t)$, the
inital configuration of which is subject to the equilibrium
distribution. In practice, we firstly run an equilibrium MD simulation
to generate a collection of configurations that are subject to the
equilibrium distribution. And then by using these configurations as
inital configuration, the Hamiltonian dynamicses are integrated until
time $t$. These trajectories are also called \emph{branching
  trajectories} in this paper. Finially, the macroscopic observable is
estimated by averaging the microscopic observable measured at the end
points of the trajectories.

Being more gneralize, if the microscopic depends not only on the end
configuation of at time $t$ but also depends on the historical
configurations along the trajectory, the experssion~\eqref{eqn:tmp4} can be generalize to
\begin{align}
  O(t) = \int d\vect x\,\rho(\vect x, 0) \int_{\mathcal C\{\vect x, 0; t\}} \hat O[\vect x_s] \,d\mathcal P[\vect x_s] 
\end{align}
where the microscopic observable $ \hat O[\vect x_s] $ is now a
functional of the trajectory.  $\mathcal C\{\vect x, 0; t\}$ is the
set of all continuous trajectories starting at point $\vect x$ at time
0, and ending at time $t$. $\mathcal P[\vect x_s] $ is the meansure of
the trajectory space $\mathcal C$.  In our case, it is the
$\delta$-function peaked around the trajectory generated by the
Hamiltonian dynamics. To be general, it can also be the measure of all
trajectories generated by, for example, a Langevin dynamics, then the
branching trajectories should be generated by the Langevin
dynamics rather than the Hamiltonian dynamics.


\subsection{Nonequilibrium temperature control}\label{sec:tmp2b}

The aformentioned nonequilibrium molecular dynamicses simulation algorithm
does not describe how the boundary of the system should be set up. The 100\% save
method is to simulate a infinitely large isolated system, or any large enough
isolated subsystem of it. In practice, it is both impossible and unnecessary to
do such a simulation. In practice, proper boundary condition should be developped
based on how the nonequilibrium system is set up, and what are the nonequilibrium
observables to measure.
Since we are mainly interested in the nonthermal~\cite{delaHoz2005microwaves} effect of
the electric field to the configuration of a solvated alanine dipeptide,
we assume the alanine is embeded into an infinitely large solvent envrionment,
and the electric field is only applied to the neighborhood of the alanine.
Therefore, 
extra heat generated by turing on the electric field can be effectively absorbed
by the envrionment.
It is argued that 
an accurate reaction temperature control is essential for being able to perform
reproducible experiments~\cite{damm2012can}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{fig/thermostat.eps}
  \caption{Schematic plot of the truncated nonequilibrium subsystem.
    The white part is the subsystem and the gray part is the boundary
    condition, implemented by the thermostat and barostat mimicing
    the infinitely large universe.}
  \label{fig:tmp2}
\end{figure}

In practice, it is impossible to simulate an infinitely large
environment.  For an equilibrium simulation, the solution is to couple
the system to a thermostat, under which the canonical ensember can be
sampled by only simulate a finite size system with periodic boundary
condition. For a nonequilibrium simulation, simply couple the system
to a thermostat may not be a good idea, because the \emph{dynamics}
generated by the thermostat is artificial, and deviation from the
Hamiltonian dynamics under investigation will introduce artificial
effects in the nonequilibrium observations. To solve this problem, we
observe that only the Hamiltonian dynamics of the alanine molecule
itself and the water molecules in the nearby solvation shell is
crutial to the configuration change, while the detailed dynamics of
the water molecules far away has less effect. Notice again we actually
do not want to precisely calculate each trajectory starting from the
initial configurations, but want to sample correctly the trajectory
ensemble correctly, so that the nonequilibrium observable can be
calculated correctly.  Therefore, instead of simulating an infinitely
large system, we only simulate a finite size system with periodic
boundary condition. The simulating region is divided into two
subregions: Near the alanine dipeptide, the dynamics is kept to be
Hamiltonian, and this subregion is called the Hamiltonian dynamics
region. While far from the alanine, the dynamics of water is coupled
to a Langevin thermostat, and this region is called the thermostating
region (see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp2}).  For simplicity, the Hamiltonian
dynamics region is assumed to be spherical, centered at the
alpha-carbon of the alanine, and with radius of $R_{ex}$.  Further, we
freeze the movment of the alpha-carbon, so that the alanine is always
located at the center of the simulation region.  The validity of this
setting will be later check by numerical examples showing that the
nonequilibrium observables do not depends on the size of the system
and the size of the Hamiltonian dynamics subregion, if they are
reasonably large and the finite size effect does not play a role.

  under a constant electric field}

    moments. Three test cases are indicated by different colors.}
  \label{fig:tmp3}
\end{figure}

We want to study the nonequilibrium properties of an alanine dipeptide
under a changing electric field. As a model system, we study the
a constant electric field. At time $t=0$~ps, the system
has been fully equilibriated without any electric field. From $t=0$ to
$t=t_{\textrm{init}}$, the electic field is switched on linearly, while
after $t=t_{\textrm{init}}$, the field is kept constant at
$E_{\infty}$. Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp3} shows the three different
cases considered in this work: $t_{\textrm{init}} = 10$, 100, and
500~ps, and 
in all cases the maximum strength of the electric field is
$E_{\infty} = 1$~V/nm.
The direction of this field is arbitarily chosen: along the
$x$ direction. Since the dipole of the equilibrium configurations of
alanine can be along any direction (see also Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp3} for
the vanished initial dipole moment), applying the electric along x-axis is
not biased.
The size of the system is $2.67\times 2.67\times
2.67\, \textsf{nm}^3$, with one alanine dipeptide described by the CHARMM27 force field, and solved in 644 TIP3P
water molecules.
All simulations are performed by a home-modified GROMACS 4.5~\cite{pronk2013gromacs}.
Firstly, an equilibrium NVT simulation of
100~\textsf{nm} was performed with a Langevin thermostat (time-scale
$\tau_T = 0.5~\textsf{ps}$) coupled to the system for constant
temperature.  Along the trajectory, configurations were taken every
5~\textsf{ps}.  They server as starting point of the branching
trajectories. The branching trajectories were integrated by the
Leap-frog scheme with the aformentioned nonequilibrium temperature control technique.  The
time step was $\Delta t = 0.002~\textsf{ps}$. The short-range
interaction was smoothed from $0.8$ to $1.0~\textsf{nm}$ by the
``switch'' method provided by Gromacs.  An energy conserving PME
method was applied to calculate the electrostatic interaction in this
periodic system. In the thermostating region, the original dyanmics was
coupled to a Langevin thermostat with $\tau_T = 0.1~\textsf{ps}$.
The whole system is also coupled to a Parrinello-Rahman barostat with $\tau_P = 2.0~\textsf{ps}$ to keep
the pressure at the ambient condition (1~Bar). Since the
change of the system size is small and slow, it does not have an obviously effect on the
dyanmics of the system.

\subsection{Metastable sets}

On each branching trajectory, to easy the analysis, the conformation
of the alanine dipeptide is plotted by the Ramachandran histogram, as
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp4}. The equilibrium distribution of the
conformation is given in the left plot, and the fully relaxed
conformation at $E_{\infty} = 1$~V/nm is given in the right plot.  It is
clear the conformations are populated in several clusters, and the
position of the clusters do not change when the external electric
field is applied. This means that only a few of the configurations are likely to be observed, while there is nearly
no oppotunity to see others. 
These configurations are called ``metastable states''. The strict definition of the
metastability is not exactly the same as those conformations that are likely to be observed.
Since in this paper we do not focus on the discussion of the definition for the metastability of the system,
we assume they have the same meaning.
We manually divide the
$\psi$--$\phi$ plane into 5 subregions, see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp4},
then the observation on the Ramachandran histogram is projected to the
observation of these 5 subregions.  These subregions
correspond to different secondary structure of a peptide chain:
$A_1$ and $A_2$ are
corresponding to the alpha helix. $B_1$ and $B_2$ are
corresponding to beta sheet. $C$ is corresponding to the
left-handed alpha helix.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{fig.ala/ext.mode1.100.Ex.01.00.t1200ps/fig-begin-1.eps}
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{fig.ala/ext.mode1.100.Ex.01.00.t1200ps/fig-end-1.eps}
  \caption{The population of different metastable state. Left: the equilibrium state at $t=0$~\textsf{ps}. Right: The non-equilibrium study state at $t=1200$~\textsf{ps}, i.e., fully relaxed when the electric field is switched on. The darker color indicates larger population on the $\psi$--$\phi$ phase space.}
  \label{fig:tmp4}
\end{figure}

From Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp4}, it is obvious that the population in each
metastable sets changes due to the external electric field, for
example, the population of conformations C vanishes in equilibrium,
but plays an important role when the electric field is applied. We
therefore want to study how the alanine changes from one conformation
to the other, how fast is the change, and the relation to the speed of
the increasing electric field (i.e. the value of $t_{init}$). 
Firly, we study the population of the metastable conformations
Being more strict, we calculate the nonequilibrium observable
\begin{align}
  P_I(t) = \mathbb P (\vect x_t \in I), \quad  I \in \{A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C\},
\end{align}
which is the time dependent probability of the alanine being in metastable
state $I$.
% Secondly, we study the
% forward and backward transition probability of the metastable conformations, which is defined by
% \begin{align}
%   P^{\fwd}_{J,I}(t) & = \mathbb P( \vect x_{t+\Delta t} \in J | \vect x_t \in I) \\
%   P^{\bwd}_{J,I}(t) & = \mathbb P( \vect x_{t-\Delta t} \in J | \vect x_t \in I) 
%   % \qquad I, J \in \{A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C\},
% \end{align}
% where $\Delta t$ is the time-scale of the observation.
% For a revserible and homogeneous Markov process, it is easy to show
% that $P^{\fwd}_{J,I} = P^{\bwd}_{J,I}$, and both of them are time independent. For a general nonequilibrium
% process considered by the present work, this relation is genarlly not guarenteed.
Secondly,
we study the net probability flux from metastable set $I$ to $J$, defined by:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:tmp7}
  F_{J,I}(t) & =\lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow 0} \frac1{\Delta t} [\mathbb P( \vect x_{t-\Delta t} \in J, \vect x_t \in I) - \mathbb P( \vect x_{t-\Delta t} \in I, \vect x_t \in J)].
\end{align}
which prensents the rate of how much conformation $J$ is changed
into $I$. A positive value indicates the
flux from $J$ to $I$, while a negative value indicates a flux from $I$ to $J$.
Now if project the proccess $\vect x_t$ onto the discretized states $\{A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C\}$. If the
project proccess is time-reversible, then it is obvious that
$ F_{J,I}(t) = 0$. In an other word, the quantity $ F_{J,I}(t) $ represents
the irreversibility of the conformational change observed in the discretized space $\{A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C\}$.
In practive, to measure $ F_{J,I}(t)$, one need firstly approximate the limit
in Eq.~\eqref{eqn:tmp7} by finite difference, then the joint probabilities on
the right-hand-side can be calculated from the molecular trajectories.
If one wants a precise finite difference approximation, a smaller $\Delta t$ is
better, but then the statistical uncertainty of measuring the joint probabilities
is higher. We use a $\Delta t$ that is small enough for a precise finite difference
approximation, and not too small so that the joint probabilities can be measured
properly.
In the oscillating EF case, the net probability flux is also highly oscillating,
so it is convenient to study the integrated probability flux:
\begin{align}
  Q_{J,I} (t) = \int_0^t F_{J,I}(\tau)d \tau,
\end{align}
which presents the time averaged effect of the EF to the molecular conformation.

%   \label{fig:tmp6}
% \end{figure}


The time-dependent probability of the system in a certain metastable set is given in
Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp5}, and different speeds of switching on the electric field
($t_{init} = 10$, 100 and 500~ps) are compared.  No matter how fast is the electric field turned
on, the beta sheet configuration, which presents at the beginning,
fades away as the system relaxes to the new equilibrium. The
population of alpha helix $A_1$ configuration grows from 45\% to 70\%.
alpha helix $A_2$  does not change a lot under the electric field.
The left-hand helix configuration $C$ noticeably grows from 0\% to 20\%.


For the case of fastly switching on electric field
($t_{\textrm{init}}=10~\textsf{ps}$),
we plot the time-dependent forward, backward transition probability and the net backward probability flux
in Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp6}.
If the process were time reversible and homogeneous, then the forward and backward transition probabilities
would be identical. As a matter of fact, the inconsistent forward and backward transition probabilities
implies the process is indeed nonequilibrium.
Together with Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp5}, we observe
three different timescales of 
the dynamics of the alanine conformation:
(1) From
$t=0$ to approximately 20~\textsf{ps}, the population of $A_1$ firstly decreases and then increases to the original value,
while the population of $A_2$ increases sharply. The plot of the net probability flux shows that 
there is firstly a fast probability flux (conformational change) from
$A_1$ to $A_2$, and then follows a probability flux with the same maganitude in the opposite direction, i.e.  from
$A_2$ to $A_1$.
In the meanwhile, a clear trend from $\beta$-sheet conformations ($B_1$ and $B_2$)
into $\alpha$-helix conformations ($A_1$, $A_2$ and $C$), both left- and right-handed,
has been established.
Also in this time-scale, strong and increasing probability flux from $B_2$ to $B_1$ is observed from Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp6}.
The population of $B_1$ remains almost unchanged,
because it  at the same time loses population to $\alpha$-helix conformations.
Since  $B_2$ conformations not only changes into $B_1$, but also into $\alpha$-helix conformations, we observe a charp
decrease of $B_2$ population between 10 and 20~ps.
(2), From $t=10$ to
100~\textsf{ps},
The net flux from  conformation $A_2$ to $A_1$ and from $B_2$ to $B_1$
gradually decays to 0. Conformational change between $\alpha$-helix and $\beta$ sheet
is hardly observed, except a very week flux from $B_1$ to $A_1$ and $C$, which will be discussed later.
At this stage, the population of $B_2$ decreases to almost 0, while the population of $A_2$
converge to a non-vanishing value of approximately 0.06.
% the population of $B_2$ decreases by 0.15, and this
% configuration almost disappears. Interestingly, the population of $A_1$
% increases by the same amount, and the population of $A_2$ goes back to
% the initial value. The populations of $B_1$ and $C$ start increasing
% and decreasing, correspondingly. The speed of these changes are much
% slower than that of $B_2$ and $A_1$.
(3) At the time scale of $
500~\textsf{ps}$, the population of $A_1$, $B_1$ and $C$ converge to
the non-equilibrium steady state (system with $E(\infty) = 1~\textsf{V/m}$).
We only observed slowing decaying probability flux from $B_1$ to $A_1$ and $C$.
The maganitude of the flux from $B_1$ to  $C$ is larger than that from  $B_1$ to  $A_1$.
It is interesting to see that at nonequilibrium steady state, $A_1$ exchange
population with $A_2$, and $B_1$ exchange
population with $B_2$. However, when the $C$ conformation hardly changes
to any other conformation, as indicated by the almost 1 value of the forward
transition probability of set $C$. This implies that at the left-handed $\alpha$-helix is
acutally more stable than  other conformations.
This time-scale is actually 50 times large than when the electric field
is fully switched on ($t_{\textrm{init}} = 10~\textsf{ps}$).
Notice that the Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp3}
shows that the x-component of the dipole moment of the alanine dipeptide
reaches the maximum value at a time scale  that is the same as
$t_{init}$. This observation indicates that the alanine can adjust almost immediately its
dipole according to the external electric field, however, the conformational change
happens at some much slower time scales.

To further test the dynamics of metastable population, two simulations
of $t_{\textrm{init}} = 100~\textsf{ps}$ and $t_{\textrm{init}} =
500~\textsf{ps}$ are performed. The first time scale of $t =
20~\textsf{ps}$ disappears in both of the testing simulations. In the
simulation of $t_{\textrm{init}} = 100~\textsf{ps}$, the population of
$A$, $B_1$ and $C$ converges to the non-equilibrium steady state at
around $500~\textsf{ps}$. This further verifies internal time scale of
$A_1$, $B_1$ and $C$ presented in the testing case of
$t_{\textrm{init}} = 10~\textsf{ps}$.  The dynamics of $B_2$ is
faster: it decays to zero as soon as the external electric field is fully
switched on. In the case of $t_{\textrm{init}} = 500~\textsf{ps}$, the
growth of the external electric field is comparable to the longest
internal time scale of system, which means that the changes of the
perturbation to the system is so slow that the system can catch up, so
the process can be treated as  quasi-equilibrium.
The numerical results show the same story: the relaxation
of all populations are around $500 \sim 600~\textsf{ps}$.


\subsection{Testing the finite-size effect}

  \label{fig:tmp7}
\end{figure}

Just described in Sec.~\ref{sec:tmp2b}, we perform nonequilibrium MD
simulations in a finite size periodic system, and further divided it
into a Hamiltonian dynamics region and a thermostating region.
Since the periodic boundary condition and the division of the system
are artificial, 
we want to understand the finite-size effect of
these settings and the their influence to the simulation result.
Therefore, we
perform two additional simulations: one has box size $L=4.0$~nm and a
Hamiltonian dynamics region of radius $R_{ex} = 1.0$~nm, while the
other has box size $L=4.0$~nm and a Hamiltonian dynamics region of
radius $R_{ex} = 1.5$~nm, and compare them to the system
we used before, i.e. $L=2.7$~nm and $R_{ex} = 1.0$~nm.
Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp7} presents very good consistency of
the simulation results of the three systems, so the finite-size effect is
actually negligible in the system we used in the previous sections.



\section{Example II:
  periodically oscillating electric field}

We have tested the periodically oscillating electric field which has
a $\sin$-wave shape:
\begin{align}
  E(t) = E_0\sin(2\pi \omega t),
\end{align}
where $E_0$ is the strength of the field, which is chosen to be
1.0~V/nm.  $\omega$ is the frequency of the field, which is related to
the period $T$ by $\omega = 1/T$.  Here we tested three different
periods: 10, 40 and 200.  the periods of the later two are
commensurate to the time scales discovered by the nonequilibrium MD
simulation of constant electric field. The first is to test the if the
period is further reduced to smaller than 20~ps, there is any other
timescale of interest would play a role. Although the periods are
chosen according to the discovered time scales in the constant
electric field simulation, the nonequilibrium phenonema of oscillating
electric field cannot fully derived from the constant field system.
As far as the electric field changes, the internal time scale of the
system also changes, therefore, the nonequilibrium probabilities is a
complicated interplay of different internal time scales under
different electric fields. We do not try to theoretically predict
what will happen under the oscillating EF by a series constant EF simulation
revealing the internal dynamics under different strength of EF, but just directly
do the nonequilibrium MD simulation for the oscillating EF, and discuss
the observed phenonema.

Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp8} presents the $x$-component of the dipole moment as
a function of time. The red, green and blue lines stands for the
results of $T=10$~ps, 40~ps and 200~ps, respectively. The black lines
shows the dipole moment of constant electric field with
$t_{init}=10$~ps for reference. It demonstrates that for all periods
investigated, the alanine can adjust it's direction, which defined by
the direction of average dipole, according to the external electric
field almost immediately. At $T=200$~ps, the maximum magnitude of the
dipole moment is almost the same as the constant electric field, which
means that the changing of the electric field is so slow that the
alanine have enough time to fully relax the internal dipole. However,
for $T=40$~ps and $T=10$~ps, when the electric field changes faster,
although the molecules can align to the electric field immediately,
but it does not have enough time to relax the internal dipole, so we
see the maximum alanine's dipole moment reached is smaller for the shorter
period.

The Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp9} shows the probability of being in a certain
metastable state for periodically oscillating electric field.  The
Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp10} presents the integrated probability flux of among
the metastable sets.
When the period is small, i.e. $T=10$~ps and
40~ps, the observed phenonema in the figures are basically the same.
The pobability in $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1$ and $B_2$ does not change
too much with respect to time,
however, the probability in metastable set $C$ astonishingly
increase to approximately 0.17 for $T=10$~ps  and 0.27 for  $T=10$~ps.
Notice that in the constant EF case, although the dipole moment is
bigger than the  $T=40$~ps case (see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp8}), the
probability of being in $C$ is indeed lower.  
The time needed to reach a steady state is
roughly 400~ps that is the same as the
constant EF case. Fig~\ref{fig:tmp10} shows some ever increasing
integrated probability fluxes, which imply some ever lasting and directional
flux among the metastable sets, see
Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp11} that presents a schematic plot of the probability
fluxes for $T=10$~ps. The probability flux of  $T=40$~ps is roughly
the same as $T=10$~ps, expect that
the flux from $B_2 $ to $A_1$ does not exist. 
This demonstrate a interesting phenonemon: the oscillating EF 
generates a directional probability flux among the metastable sets.
Moreover, some loops of the flux are detected: $A_1 \rightarrow B_1
\rightarrow B_2 \rightarrow A_2 \rightarrow A_1$, $A_1 \rightarrow B_1
\rightarrow B_2 \rightarrow A_1$,  $A_1 \rightarrow B_1
\rightarrow B_2 \rightarrow C \rightarrow A_1$ and $B_1
\rightarrow B_2 \rightarrow C \rightarrow B_1$.

  \label{fig:tmp11}
\end{figure}


When the period is $T=200$~ps, the phenonema are substentially different
from the high frequency cases ($T=10$ and 40~ps). Firstly, from Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp9}, the system reaches staedy state after around 2000~ps, while
Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp10} suggests an even long time scale, but we cannot draw
a very clear conclusion on it
due to the lack of computational power to perform even longer simulations. 
The steady probability of being in state $C$ is roughly the same as the
case of $T=40$~ps, although the maximum dipole moment is actually higher
than the latter. And the steady probability  of being in state $C$ is
also higher than the constant EF case, even the maximum dipole are roughly
the same. The time spend to reach the steady state is much longer than
the higher frequency cases, so this indicates a \emph{dynamically} longer time
scale in the system, comparing with the static EF case, in which all time scales
are actually decided by the \emph{static} external field. We also observe
a suden change in the probability flux from set $A_2$ to $A_1$ at
around 1600~ps, which may imply a \emph{dynamically} rare event.
Since we do not have the computer power to perform even longer simulations,
this hypothesis is not further checked.




% Clearly two time-scales of relaxation are observed.  For
% configurations $A_2$ and $B_2$, the relaxations are very fast and
% comparable to $t_{\textrm{init}}$. For configurations $A_1$, $B_1$ and
% $C$, the time-scales of relaxation are roughly 600~\textsf{ps}.

% \section{Testing the effect of the thermostat and barostat}

% % \section{System set up}

% % $R_{\textrm{ex}}$ was chosen to be
% % $1.0$~\textsf{nm}, which means that a Langvin thermostat ($\tau =
% % 0.1~\textsf{ps}$) was applied to water molecules that were more than
% % $1.0$~\textsf{nm} away from the center of the simulation box. In
% % addition, a Parrinello-Rahman barostat was couple to the system with a
% % time-scale of $\tau_{\textrm{P}} = 2.0~\textsf{ps}$. 


% Let's consider an infinitely large NVE system (here we call it
% "universe"). Some interesting process is happening in a small
% subsystem. For equilibrium phenomena, this subsystem is the usually
% considered as NVT (or NPT, $\mu$VT, depends on how the question is
% raised) system.  In simulations, we only simulate the subsystem and
% use the thermostat to mimic the embedment into the universe.  For
% non-equilibrium simulation, we also want to simulate only the
% subsystem of interest, but the physical meaning of directly applying a
% thermostat designed for generating equilibrium ensemble is not clear
% to a non-equilibrium process. Moreover, there is no unique way of
% defining how the subsystem is coupled into the universe: It is subject
% to how the perturbation comes into the subsystem, and how the energy
% of the system dissipates into the universe. In the case of switching on
% electric field system, two limiting scenarios are considered by us: (1)
% The subsystem is isolated from the universe: The electric field is
% applied to a system that conserves the energy, volume and number of
% particle (i.e. a NVE subsystem in short).  The isolation here means
% that the subsystem does not exchange energy, volume and number of
% particle with the universe, but the perturbation (electric field) does
% come in to the subsystem.  The periodic boundary condition is applied
% here only to avoid the difficulty of defining a experimental
% meaningful boundary in simulation.  In this scenario, the size the
% subsystem is somewhat arbitrary (it depends on experimental setting),
% therefore, it is important to consider the convergence of the
% simulation result with respect to the size of the subregion.  (2) The
% system exchange the energy, volume and particle with the universe, and
% the universe is so big that the perturbation in the subsystem will not
% kick the universe from equilibrium.  In practice, it is impossible to
% simulate the infinite large universe, Instead, we want to simulate the
% considerably smaller subsystem instead.  The idea is to divide the
% simulation region into two parts (see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp2}): the first
% is called \emph{Newtonian dynamics region} that is a region around the
% molecule of interest, where the dynamics is Newtonian. Note that the
% molecular trajectories in the Newtonian dynamics region are the same
% as if it were couple to the universe, only when a proper boundary
% condition is provided. Strictly speaking, the boundary should be
% provided by the out side infinitely large universe, which immediately
% leads back to the numerical difficulty of simulating a infinite large
% system. However, we notice that the detailed information
% (i.e. position and velocity) of the every molecule outside the
% Newtonian dynamics region is not relevant to the non-equilibrium
% behavior of the molecule of interest, because we are only interest in
% the non-equilibrium averages, which does not depends on the individual
% trajectory, but on the trajectorial ensemble sampled by the
% non-equilibrium simulation.  Therefore, the universe, as a boundary to
% the Newtonian dynamics region, can be replace by
% an efficiently thermo- and barostated subsystem, as indicated by the gray
% part of Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp2}. 
% % That is to say the subsystem is coupled to a
% % thermostat, a barostat and a particle bath with infinitely high
% % efficiency. Practically, it is impossible to simulation with a
% % ``infinitely fast'' thermostat, barostat and particle bath.
% We indicate the radius of the Newtonian dynamics region by
% $R_{\textrm{ex}} = 1~\textsf{nm}$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp2} for
% explanation), and couple it to very sufficient thermo- and
% barostat. We use a Langevin thermostat coupled to the thermostating
% region with a time-scale of $\tau_{T} = 0.1~\textsf{ps}$, and a
% Parrinello-Rahman barostat with a time-scale of $\tau_{P} =
% 2.0~\textsf{ps}$.

% The non-equilibrium steady temperature and pressure of the
% non-thermostated simulation are $330$ K and $-500$ Bar,
% correspondingly. Those of the thermostated system are $300$ K and 1
% Bar, correspondingly. Therefore, we can see from Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp6}
% that the relaxation of the thermostated system is faster than the
% non-thermostated system. The three time-scale of metastable population
% dynamics in the thermostated system is consistent with that of the
% non-thermostated system. This means that thermostating, in this case,
% does not qualitatively change the population dynamics of metastable
% states.

% % To make the non-equilibrium feasible, we assume the
% % non-equilibrium process is \emph{local}, i.e. the non-equilibrium perturbation
% % of the system happens only locally, and the rest of the system
% % stays the unperturbed (usually assumed under ambient conditions).
% % This provides us the possibility of simulating only the small subsystem
% % of the universe: We can simulate only subsystem by providing proper
% % boundary condition for it, so that it behaves as if it were embeded into
% % the universe.

% % In this study, we firstly consider the system of a methane molecule solvated
% % in the liquid water environment. A local density perturbation is implemented
% % by applying an impluse  in a shell surronding methane, see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp1}.
% % % As far as we concerned, the situation is: we truncate the universe to the
% % % subsystem, and provide proper boundary condition for this
% % % subsystem.
% % Here we denote the size of this subsystem by $R_{\ex}$.
% % Notice this subsystem is simulated by the Newtonian
% % dynamics. If the size of the
% % subsystem is large enough so that the perturbation is
% % small enough when it travels to the boundary of the subsystem, then a
% % trivial boundary condition would be: coupling the system to a boundary
% % layer equilibriated by the thermostat (and barostat or particle reservior),
% % which mimics the infinitely large equilibrium universe.
