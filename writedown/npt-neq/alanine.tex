\section{Introduction}


The possible effect of the electric field (EF) on the conformation of
proteins is a subject of increasing attention since it is linked to the problem of exposing human tissues to
electromagnetic radiation. Despite its major relevance, a
satisfactory understanding of how the EF influences the behaviour of proteins
has not been reached so far although a considerable number of
experimental~\cite{bohr2000microwave, bohr2000microwave-1,
  dePomerai2000cell, inskip2001cellular, mancinelli2004non} and
theoretical~\cite{budi2005electric, budi2007effect,
  budi2008comparative, toschi2008effects, astrakas2011electric,
  astrakas2012structural, damm2012can, starzyk2013proteins,
  english2009nonequilibrium, solomentsev2012effects} studies have been devoted to this topic;
where the references reported above represent only a minor sample of examples.


In this perspective, molecular dynamics (MD) has been proved to be useful in
understanding the behavior of a protein 
in both static and oscillatory EF~\cite{budi2005electric, budi2007effect, budi2008comparative,
  toschi2008effects, astrakas2011electric, astrakas2012structural,
  damm2012can, starzyk2013proteins, english2009nonequilibrium,
  solomentsev2012effects}. In these studies, the initial
configurations are usually taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB),
and then temperature controlled simulations are performed for a maximum extension of the order of 10-60 of nanoseconds.
During this simulation time 
relevant conformational changes characterizing the solvated molecule can be observed. 
Along the trajectories, various observable, such as the
secondary structure, root mean square displacement (RMSD), the dipole
moment, shape parameters are calculated as a function of time or taking its time average. This approach releases useful information on how the
secondary structure of the molecule is changed by external  EF.  However,
by plotting some quantities against time, one may observe strong
fluctuations; the entity of such fluctuations are such that a quantitative 
analysis becomes difficult and does not allow for  a clear understanding of the rationale behind the conformational changes.
Although the time average reduces the statistical uncertainty,
however in this specific case, it is indeed not well defined;
in fact we are in the presence of a nonequilibrium process
(e.g. relaxing process to the new conformations under a static
EF, or the dynamics from one conformation to the other under an oscillatory EF).

In this perspective, if one wants to use MD, the proper way to do it would be that of treating a situation of non equilibrium with algorithms that can explicitly describe it. This is the approach that will be followed in this work.

The method we employ is the dynamical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation (D-NEMD).
The method was firstly developed by one of us (GC) and coworkers~\cite{ciccotti1975direct, ciccotti1979thought}.
It has been recently applied, with success, to the study of
hydrodynamics~\cite{orlandini2011hydrodynamics,
  orlandini2011hydrodynamics-01}. The essential feature of D-NEMD is the following: It provides a way of evaluating
nonequilibrium observables by using a properly determined ensemble of nonequilibrium MD
simulations.  In this context, the method can be used for analyzing the
conformational changes of a solvated molecule, subject to a time-dependent EF.
In the present paper, we study a small peptide, alanine dipeptide, as a model for showing how the method can be used. 
The choice of a small peptide, rather than a larger one, is done firstly because it
is easier to draw clear conclusions on the nonequilibrium properties
of a single peptide by excluding a possible interplay between
different peptide segments along a chain.
Secondly, the computational cost required is rather massive and thus the testing of the various methodolgy developments proposed here would not be easy to accomplish for large molecules. Of course, given a positive coming out for such a model system, the aim is that of approaching systems of growing complexity.
The paper is organized as follows:
We firstly describe the idea of D-NEMD, then
introduce the physical
observables for analyzing the nonequilibrium properties. The numerical results of alanine
dipeptide under static and sine-shaped oscillatory EF are
finally presented. By calculating the nonequilibrium properties from D-NEMD
simulations, we are able to address the question of how the peptide
changes the conformation in a EF (conformational space), when do these changes happens (time scale),
and how likely they are (probability). 
To our knowledge, this study is one of the few (if not the first)  where non equilibrium is explicitly considered for a large molecule in solution bubject to time-dependent EF.



\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation}
In this section we briefly review the approach for performing dynamical nonequilibrium
molecular dynamics (D-NEMD) \cite{ciccotti1975direct, ciccotti1979thought,
  orlandini2011hydrodynamics, orlandini2011hydrodynamics-01}.
In the following we denote the macroscopic observable by $O(t)$. If at $t$
the configurational probability distribution is $\rho(\vect x, t)$, where
$\vect x$ is the phase space variable, then the observable can be
expressed by
\begin{align}\label{eqn:tmp1}
  O(t) = \int d\vect x\, \hat O(\vect x)\rho(\vect x, t)  = \langle \hat O(\vect x), \rho(\vect x, t)\rangle,
\end{align}
we refer to $\hat O (\vect x)$ as the microscopic observable, 
which is measured at each point in the phase space $\vect x$.
Here we always assume that the initial probability distribution
$\rho(\vect x, 0)$ is known and is identical to the equilibrium distribution of the system
without EF.
The bracket on the right hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eqn:tmp1} denotes, as usual, the inner product in the
phase space.  We assume tthat he dynamics of the system is governed by the
Hamiltonian equation, i.e. $\dot {\vect x} = J \cdot \nabla_{\vect x}
\mathcal H(\vect x)$, where $\mathcal H$ is the Hamiltonian, and $J$ is
the symplectic matrix. The Liouville equation for the probability
distribution writes:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:tmp2}
  \frac{\partial \rho(\vect x, t)}{\partial t} = - iL(t) \rho(\vect x, t),
\end{align}
where $iL(t) = \{\cdot, \mathcal H\}$ is the Liouville operator.
Eq.~\eqref{eqn:tmp2}
can be formally solved by $\rho(\vect x, t) = e^{-iL(t)} \rho(\vect x, 0)$.
On the other hand
\begin{align}
  \frac{d \hat O(\vect x(t))}{dt} = \nabla_{\vect x}\hat O\cdot \dot{\vect x}
  = \nabla_{\vect x}\hat O\cdot J\cdot \nabla_{\vect x}\mathcal H
  = iL(t) \hat O (\vect x(t))
\end{align}
This equation can be formally solved by $\hat O(\vect x(t)) = e^{iL(t)} \hat O(\vect x(0))$, therefore,
\begin{align}\nonumber
  O(t) & = \langle \hat O(\vect x), \rho(\vect x, t)\rangle
  = \langle \hat O(\vect x), e^{-iL(t)} \rho(\vect x, 0)\rangle
  = \langle e^{iL(t)}\hat O(\vect x), \rho(\vect x, 0)\rangle\\\label{eqn:tmp4}
  &= \langle \hat O(\vect x(t)), \rho(\vect x, 0)\rangle
\end{align}
Since we assume that the system starts from the distribution of equilibrium (without EF)
 Eq.~\eqref{eqn:tmp4} expresses the fact that the 
observable $O(t)$ calculated in a situation of nonequilibrium is equal to the ensemble average of
the microscopic observable measured along trajectories, the
initial configurations of which are subject to the \emph{equilibrium}
distribution. In practical terms we proceed by first running an equilibrium MD simulation
to generate a sample of configurations. Next we employ these configurations as
initial configurations and, for each, the Hamiltonian dynamics is integrated until
time $t$. These trajectories are also called \emph{branching
  trajectories} in this paper (see Fig.\ref{branching} for a pictorial representation). 
Finally, the value of the macroscopic observable at time $t$ is
calculated by averaging the microscopic observable measured at each time $t$ along each branching trajectory.

%Being more generalized, if the microscopic observable depends not only on the end
%configuration at time $t$, but also on the historical
%configurations along the trajectory, then expression~\eqref{eqn:tmp4} takes the generalized form:
%\begin{align}
%  O(t) = \int d\vect x\,\rho(\vect x, 0) \int_{\mathcal C\{\vect x, 0; t\}} \hat O[\vect x_s] \,d\mathcal P[\vect x_s] 
%\end{align}
%where the microscopic observable $ \hat O[\vect x_s] $ is now a
%functional of the trajectory.  $\mathcal C\{\vect x, 0; t\}$ is the
%set of all continuous trajectories starting at point $\vect x$ at time
%0, and ending at time $t$. $\mathcal P[\vect x_s] $ is the measure of
%the trajectory space $\mathcal C$.  In our case, it is the
%$\delta$-function peaked around the trajectories governed by the
%Hamiltonian dynamics. To be general, it can also be the measure of all
%trajectories generated by, for example, a Langevin dynamics, then the
%branching trajectories should be generated by the Langevin
%dynamics rather than the Hamiltonian dynamics.

% The aforementioned D-NEMD simulation algorithm
% does not describe how the boundary of the system should be set up.
% The very naive idea of doing the simulation
% is to simulate a infinitely large isolated system, or any large enough
% isolated subsystem of it.
% In practice, 
% Therefore, we are interested in a 
For this study We are interested in 
nonthermal~\cite{delaHoz2005microwaves} effects of the EF
on the configuration of the solvated alanine dipeptide.
For this reason a proper control of the temperature in a nonequilibrium system
becomes an important issue; in fact it was argued that  an
accurate control of the internal reaction temperature is essential for being able to
perform reproducible experiments~\cite{damm2012can}.
A straigthforward (and realistic) implementation of the temperature control consists in 
embedding the alanine into an infinitely large solvent environment, and 
the EF is only applied to the neighborhood of the alanine. In this case
any extra heat generated by the EF can be effectively
dispersed in the large solvent environment.
In this way one can identify the effect of the EF on the conformational space of the solvated molecule,
without the artifact that the surrounding solvant cannot release the additional energy of the EF.
However, in practice, in most of the cases the computational cost of having large solvant environment is rather massive if not prohibitive.
Therefore, it is of interest to substitute the infinitely large
solvent environment with a smaller affordable system and at the same time accurately reproduce the nonequilibrium
physical properties of interest.

As it is well known, in MD, for equilibrium situation, the solution is to couple
the system to a an external thermostat, under which the desired ensemble
(canonical in this case) can be
sampled by simulating a finite size system with periodic boundary
conditions.
However, coupling the system to a thermostat for non equilibrium situations is a delicate issue.
In fact, since a thermostat is explicitly designed to bring the system at equilibrium, any perturbation produced by the EF, would be mostly adsorbed by the thermostat. This means that the physics of the original Hamiltonian dynamics with the EF would be lost and the response to the perturbation becomes unphysical. 
%will disturb the original Hamiltonian dynamics. This is
%in general problematic, 
%because the dynamics  under thermostating is artificial designed,
%so that the equilibrium distribution can be correctly produce, but not
%the nonequilibrium properties of system.
% dynamics of the system is no longer Hamiltonian, and is
% artificial designed to reach the equilibrium probability distribution.
% However, for a nonequilibrium system, the \emph{dynamics} properties
% will be distrubed by the thermostat, because the
% dynamics of the system is no longer Hamiltonian, and is
% artificial designed to reach the equilibrium probability distribution.
% For a nonequilibrium simulation, simply couple the system
% to a thermostat may not be a good idea, because the \emph{dynamics}
% generated by the thermostat is artificial, and deviation from the
% Hamiltonian dynamics under investigation will introduce artificial
% a effects in the nonequilibrium observations.
In this section we propose a procedure to solve the problem: we
observe the Hamiltonian dynamics (without thermostat) of the alanine 
itself and the water molecules in the closer solvation shells is
crucial in order to determine the response of the observable of interest
under the perturbation of the EF (in this work, it is the conformational change of alanine).
Instead the detailed dynamics of
the water molecules far away is not of primary importance, that is the region beyond the first solvation shells plays the role of a thermodynamic bath only. 
Therefore, instead of simulating an infinitely
large system, we only simulate a finite size system with periodic
boundary condition with the following characteristics. The simulating region is divided in two
subregions: a spherically defined region around the alanine dipeptide, centered at the
alpha-carbon of radius $R_{ex}$. Here the dynamics is
Hamiltonian and molecules are not subject to a thermosat; we refer to such subregion as \emph{the Hamiltonian dynamics
region}. Instead beyond $R_{ex}$, the dynamics of water is coupled
to a Langevin thermostat, and this region is called \emph{the thermostated
region} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp2}). For technical convenience we
fix the position of the alpha-carbon in space, so that the alanine is always
located at the center of the simulation region.
Therefore, a realistic non equilibrium  dynamics is preseved in the Hamiltonian dynamics region (where the properties of interest are observed)
and possible direct artificial effects of the thermostating process in the region outside are negligible because of the finite correlation
range of liquid water.
At the same time, the thermostated region works as a infinitely large
environment that effectively absorbs the extra heat produced by the EF.
The validity of the above
statement will be later on carefully checked by a series of numerical tests where it is shown that
the response of observables in nonequilibrium (i.e. under the effect of the EF) does not depend on the size of the system
and on the size of the Hamiltonian dynamics subregion, provided that they are
reasonably large.

\section{Example I: Alanine dipeptide
  under a uniform  constant EF}

\subsection{System settings and simulation protocol}
At time $t=0$~ps, the system
has been fully equilibriated without any EF. From $t=0$ to
warm-up time $t=t_{\textrm{warm}}$, the eclectic field is switched on linearly, while
after $t=t_{\textrm{warm}}$, the field is kept constant in time at
$E_{\infty}$.  In this work we consider $t_{\textrm{warm}} = 10$~ps,
and $E_{\infty} = 1$~V/nm.
The direction of the field is arbitrarily chosen along the
$x$ direction, in fact the dipole of the equilibrium configurations of
alanine can be along any direction.
In this paper we denote the
EF as a function of time $\vect E(t)$.
Therefore, the constant EF is
$\vect E(t) = (E_\infty\cdot t/t_{warm},0,0)$ as $0\leq t < t_{warm}$, and 
$\vect E(t) = (E_\infty,0,0)$
as $t \geq t_{warm}$.
The system is set up in a $2.7\times 2.7\times
2.7\, \textsf{nm}^3$ periodic simulation region, with one alanine dipeptide
described by the CHARMM27 force field, and solved in 644 TIP3P
water molecules.
%The EF exserts force $\vect F = q \vect E(t)$ on
%the partial charge $q$ in the system.
The size of the  Hamiltonian dynamics region is $R_{ex} = 1.0$~nm.
All simulations are performed by a home-modified GROMACS 4.5~\cite{pronk2013gromacs}.
First, an equilibrium NVT simulation of
100~\textsf{ns} was performed with a Langevin thermostat (time-scale
$\tau_T = 0.5~\textsf{ps}$).  Along the trajectory, configurations were taken every
50~\textsf{ps} and we used 2000 initial configurations for each nonequilibrium
MD simulation (if not stated otherwise for specific cases).
% They server as starting point of the branching
% trajectories.
The branching trajectories were integrated by the
Leap-frog scheme with the aforementioned nonequilibrium
temperature control technique.  The
time step was $\Delta t = 0.002~\textsf{ps}$. The short-range
interaction was smoothed from $0.8$ to $1.0~\textsf{nm}$ by the
``switch'' method provided by Gromacs.  An energy conserving PME
method was applied to calculate the electrostatic interaction in this
periodic system. In the thermostated region, the original dynamics was
coupled to a Langevin thermostat with $\tau_T = 0.1~\textsf{ps}$.
The whole system is also coupled to a Parrinello-Rahman barostat with $\tau_P = 2.0~\textsf{ps}$ to keep
the pressure at the ambient condition (1~Bar). Since the
change of the system size is small and slow, the pressure control
does not have an sizeable effect on the
dynamics of the system.

  \label{fig:tmp4}
\end{figure}


For each branching trajectory,  the molecular configuration of alanine is projected on
the Ramachandran histogram, as
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp4}. The equilibrium distribution of the
conformations is given in the plot (a), and the fully relaxed
conformation under the action of $E_{\infty} = 1$~V/nm is given  plot (b).  It is
evident from the plot that the conformations are grouped in several clusters, and the
position of the clusters does not change when the external electric
field is applied.
% {\bf LUIGI COMMENT: HAN below is really not clear}\\
% This means that only few of the total of conformations are likely to be visited,
% in the nonequilibrium process.
% These conformations are called ``metastable states''.
% The strict definition of the
% metastability is not exactly the same as those conformations that are likely to be observed.
% Since in this paper we do not focus on the discussion of the definition for the metastability of the system,
% we do not distinguish the definations, and assume they have the same meaning.
% {\bf END COMMENT}\\
For the sake of clarity, we divide the
Ramachandran histogram into 5 subregions, see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp4},
then the analysis of conformations on the Ramachandran histogram is reduced to the
analysis of the 5 ranges of conformations, i.e. $\{A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C\}$,
or in short we call them conformations (the precise meaning is clear
from the context).
In this paper we use:
$A_1 = \{(\phi, \psi) | -134 \leq \phi <  13, -125 \leq \psi < 74\}$,
$A_2 = \{(\phi, \psi) |  128 \leq \phi <-134, -125 \leq \psi < 74\}$,
$B_1 = \{(\phi, \psi) | -110 \leq \phi <  13,   74 \leq \psi <-125\}$,
$B_2 = \{(\phi, \psi) |  128 \leq \phi <-110,   74 \leq \psi <-125\}$,
$C   = \{(\phi, \psi) |   13 \leq \phi < 128, -180 \leq \psi < 180\}$.
Considering the periodic bondary condition, if we write, for example,
$128 \leq \phi <-134$, it means that $\phi$ is in either range
$128 \leq \phi < 180$ or in $-180 \leq \phi < -134$.
These conformations
correspond to different secondary structures of a peptide chain:
$A_1$ and $A_2$ are
corresponding to the alpha helix. $B_1$ and $B_2$ are
corresponding to the beta sheet. $C$ is corresponding to the
left-handed alpha helix.


From Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp4}, it is obvious that the population in each
range of conformations changes when the external EF is applied.
For instance, the population of conformation $C$ vanishes in equilibrium,
but plays an important role when the EF is applied. We
therefore want to study how the alanine changes from one conformation
to the other, how fast is the change, and the relations to the 
the EF. 
Firstl, we calculate the probability of being in a certain conformation range,
defined as:
\begin{align}
  P_I(t) = \mathbb P (\vect x_t \in I), \quad  I \in \{A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C\},
\end{align}
Notice that the probability is time dependent, being an observable in nonequilibrium situation.
% which is the time dependent probability of the alanine being in metastable
% state $I$.
% Secondly, we study the
% forward and backward transition probability of the metastable conformations, which is defined by
% \begin{align}
%   P^{\fwd}_{J,I}(t) & = \mathbb P( \vect x_{t+\Delta t} \in J | \vect x_t \in I) \\
%   P^{\bwd}_{J,I}(t) & = \mathbb P( \vect x_{t-\Delta t} \in J | \vect x_t \in I) 
%   % \qquad I, J \in \{A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C\},
% \end{align}
% where $\Delta t$ is the time-scale of the observation.
% For a revserible and homogeneous Markov process, it is easy to show
% that $P^{\fwd}_{J,I} = P^{\bwd}_{J,I}$, and both of them are time independent. For a general nonequilibrium
% process considered by the present work, this relation is genarlly not guarenteed.
Second,
we study the net probability flux from conformation $I$ to $J$, defined by:
\begin{align}\nonumber
  F_{J,I}(t) & =\lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow 0} \frac1{\Delta t} [\mathbb P( \vect x_{t-\Delta t} \in J, \vect x_t \in I) - \mathbb P( \vect x_{t-\Delta t} \in I, \vect x_t \in J)], \\\label{eqn:tmp7}
  & J,I \in \{A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C\}.
\end{align}
$F_{J,I}(t)$ is essentially the rate of how much conformation $J$ changes
into $I$ at time $t$. A positive value indicates the
net flux from $J$ to $I$,
while a negative value indicates a net flux from $I$ to $J$.
Through $F_{J,I}(t)$, the original overall nonequilibrium process $\vect x_t$
is reduced to the probabilistic link between discretized conformations $\{A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C\}$.
If the resulting reduced process 
is time-reversible, then it is obvious that
$ F_{J,I}(t) = 0$. In an other word, the quantity $ F_{J,I}(t) $ represents
the irreversibility of the reduced process on
$\{A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C\}$.
In practice, to measure $ F_{J,I}(t)$, one need first to approximate the limit
in Eq.~\eqref{eqn:tmp7} by the finite difference,
then calculate the joint probabilities on
the right-hand-side from the molecular trajectories.
In this context, for a precise finite difference approximation a smaller $\Delta t$ is
preferable although the statistical uncertainty of measuring the joint probabilities
is higher. In practice,
we use a $\Delta t$ that is small enough for a precise finite difference approximation,
and not small enough so that the joint probabilities can be calculated with acceptable accuracy.
In the case of oscillatory EF, the net probability flux is also highly oscillatory,
thus it is convenient to study the integrated probability flux:
\begin{align}
  Q_{J,I} (t) = \int_0^t F_{J,I}(\tau)d \tau,
\end{align}
this expresses the average over time of the effects of the EF on the conformation of the molecule.

The time-dependent probability of the system in a certain range of conformations is given in
Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp5}. The beta sheet conformations $B_1$ and $B_2$,
which are present at the initial stage after EF is switched on,
fade away as the system relaxes to the new equilibrium. The
probability of alpha helix $A_1$ conformation grows from 0.45 to 0.69.
Alpha helix $A_2$  does not change significantly  under the action of EF.
The left-hand helix conformation $C$ noticeably grows from 0 to 0.22.

We plot the net probability fluxes and their integration in Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp6}.
Results show that for short $t$, the net fluxes are generally non-zero, however, 
as $t$ goes to infinity,
all fluxes converge to zero. This indicates
that as the EF is switched on, the system first is driven away from the initial
equilibrium (at zero EF), and this is a nonequilibrium process, 
after a long enough time, the system
is fully relaxed to the new equilibrium defined by the action of the constant EF,
and stays there as long as the EF is kept.

  \label{tab:tmp1}
\end{table}

Even though the system is finally relaxed to the new equilibrium,
the timescale of relaxation of each conformation is different. 
From Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp6}, we observe mainly
three different timescales, as summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:tmp1}.
(1) From
$t=0$ to approximately 10~\textsf{ps}, a net flux from 
a flux from $A_1$ to $A_2$.
A similar flux is also observed from $B_1$ to $B_2$.
Afterwards, these two fluxes vanish and are finally reversed,
i.e. $A_2$ to $A_1$ and $B_2$ to $B_1$, respectively.
% the population of $A_1$ firstly decreases and then increases to the original value,
% while the population of $A_2$ increases sharply. The plot of the net probability flux shows that 
% there is firstly a fast probability flux (conformational change) from
% $A_1$ to $A_2$, and then follows a probability flux with the same maganitude in the opposite direction, i.e.  from
% $A_2$ to $A_1$.
Instead a net flux from all $\beta$-sheet conformations
($B_1$ and $B_2$) into $\alpha$-helix conformations ($A_1$, $A_2$ and
$C$) has been established.
% Also in this time-scale, strong and increasing probability flux from $B_2$ to $B_1$ is observed from Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp6}.
% The population of $B_1$ remains almost unchanged,
% because it  at the same time loses population to $\alpha$-helix conformations.
% Since  $B_2$ conformations not only changes into $B_1$, but also into $\alpha$-helix conformations, we observe a charp
% decrease of $B_2$ population between 10 and 20~ps.
(2), From $t=10$ to
100~\textsf{ps},
The net flux from  conformation $A_2$ to $A_1$ and from $B_2$ to $B_1$
gradually decays to 0. Conformational changes from $B_2$ to $A_1$, $A_2$ and $C$
vanishes in about 50~ps.
% The net flux from $B_1$  to $A_1$ and $C$ decay slower and 
% will be discussed later.
At this stage, the probability of $B_2$ decreases to almost 0,
while the probability of $A_2$
converge to a non-vanishing value of approximately 0.06.
% the population of $B_2$ decreases by 0.15, and this
% configuration almost disappears. Interestingly, the population of $A_1$
% increases by the same amount, and the population of $A_2$ goes back to
% the initial value. The populations of $B_1$ and $C$ start increasing
% and decreasing, correspondingly. The speed of these changes are much
% slower than that of $B_2$ and $A_1$.
(3) At the time scale of $
500~\textsf{ps}$, the population of $A_1$, $B_1$ and $C$ converge to
the new equilibrium (system with $E(\infty) = 1~\textsf{V/m}$).
We observe a decaying probability flux from $B_1$ 
to $A_1$ and $C$.
The magnitude of the flux from $B_1$ to  $C$ is larger than that of $B_1$ to  $A_1$.
% It is interesting to see that at nonequilibrium steady state, $A_1$ exchange
% population with $A_2$, and $B_1$ exchange
% population with $B_2$. However, when the $C$ conformation hardly changes
% to any other conformation, as indicated by the almost 1 value of the forward
% transition probability of set $C$. This implies that at the left-handed $\alpha$-helix is
% acutally more stable than  other conformations.
This time-scale is actually 50 times slower than that, at which
the EF was switched on ($t_{\textrm{warm}} = 10~\textsf{ps}$).

% After aligning to the external EF, the alanine slowly adjust its conformation,
% and the new equilibrium is reached at slower time scales.

% To further test the dynamics of metastable population, two simulations
% of $t_{\textrm{warm}} = 100~\textsf{ps}$ and $t_{\textrm{warm}} =
% 500~\textsf{ps}$ are performed. The first time scale of $t =
% 20~\textsf{ps}$ disappears in both of the testing simulations. In the
% simulation of $t_{\textrm{warm}} = 100~\textsf{ps}$, the population of
% $A$, $B_1$ and $C$ converges to the non-equilibrium steady state at
% around $500~\textsf{ps}$. This further verifies internal time scale of
% $A_1$, $B_1$ and $C$ presented in the testing case of
% $t_{\textrm{warm}} = 10~\textsf{ps}$.  The dynamics of $B_2$ is
% faster: it decays to zero as soon as the external EF is fully
% switched on. In the case of $t_{\textrm{warm}} = 500~\textsf{ps}$, the
% growth of the external EF is comparable to the longest
% internal time scale of system, which means that the changes of the
% perturbation to the system is so slow that the system can catch up, so
% the process can be treated as  quasi-equilibrium.
% The numerical results show the same story: the relaxation
% of all populations are around $500 \sim 600~\textsf{ps}$.

\subsection{Molecular Dipole response}

    moments. The left vertical axis is for the dipole moment, while
    the right is for the orientational order parameter.
  }
  \label{fig:tmp3}
\end{figure}

The Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp3}
shows that the $x$-component of the dipole moment of the alanine dipeptide
reaches 85\% of the maximum value in only 20~ps, which is comparable to
the warm-up time $t_{warm}$, and is 25 times
smaller than the slowest time scale of the conformational relaxation.
Then in the following 400~ps, the dipole slowly relaxes to the 
maximum value, that is, 
6.8~Debye, and  corresponds to a dipole energy of ca. $-13.6$~kJ/mol.
We calculate the averaged dipole moment of different conformations
under the constant EF, and they are 6.8, 6.0, 5.1, 3.1 and 7.1~Debye
for $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1$, $B_2$ and $C$, respectively.
The dipole energy difference between 3.1 and 7.1~Debye is roughly 8.0~kJ/mol.
The free energy barriers between the
conformations were reported to be of order $20\sim 40$~kJ/mol~\cite{bohner2012algorithm},
which is comparable to the dipole energy difference. 
Therefore, under a constant EF, the system will be driven towards those
conformations with higher dipole moment, because the
energy of the system will be lowered.  This is the reason why
we observe that the $\beta$-sheet conformations with lower dipole moment
are driven towars $\alpha$-helix conformations, 
and $A_1$ and $C$ are conformations with higher probability, because their dipole moments are the highest
among all conformations. Moreover, the $B_2$ conformation vanishes because
its dipole is significantly lower than other conformations.
% This also explains the two-time scale behavior of the molecular dipole
% moment.
From 0 to 20~ps, the probability of
lowest dipole conformation $B_2$ quickly
vanishes. We observe a sharp increment of the average molecular dipole and finally, approaching  500~ps, the conformation slowly migrates from
$B_1$ to $A_1$ and $C$. Moreover, since the dipole moment $A_1$ and $C$
is higher than $B_1$, the average molecular dipole moment slowly increases
to the nonequilibrium steady value.
\subsection{Response of the orientational order parameter}

We also consider the orientation of the alanine dipeptide in space (w.r.t. the direction of EF) as a function
of time.
The geometric direction of the alanine is defined by the red vector in
Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp3}, which is the angle bisector of the two black vectors.
The black vectors are defined in such a way that they connect the $\alpha$-carbon and the carbons
on the methyl groups. We define the orientational order parameter by
\begin{align}
  S_\theta = \langle 3\sin^2\theta - 2\rangle,
\end{align}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the orientation of the alanine dipeptide
and the direction of the EF. The order parameter
indicate how perpendicular does the molecule lie w.r.t. the EF.
If the molecule is perfectly perpendicular to the EF, then $S_\theta = 1$;
If the molecule has no directional
preference , then $S_\theta = 0$;
If the molecule lies perfectly parallel to the EF, then $S_\theta = -2$.
From $t=0$ to roughly 10~ps, the orientational order parameter fastly
decreases from 0 to $-0.15$, which means a weak alignment of the molecule to the external field.
Then from $t=0$ to 500~ps, the molecule slowly changes to the orientation
that is perpendicular to the EF.
This orientational change is linked to the observed slowest
time scale of the molecular conformational change.


\subsection{Effects of EF on the solvant around the molecule}
% This indicate that when the EF is switched on, the alanine almost immediately
% changes its conformation so that the molecular dipole is aligned to the
% external EF.
% align itself to the
% direction of the external EF without much conformational change.
% And then, the conformation is slowly adjusted according to the
% external field (now it is the same as the molecular dipole),
% finally  the new equilibrium is reached at a much slower time scale
% (approximately 500~ps).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% solvent effect
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We study the solvent effect on the alanine dipeptide in the presence of the EF by investigating
the radial distribution function between $\alpha$-carbon and the
center-of-mass (COM) of the water molecules
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp7a}). The average, relative position of the COM of water molecules measured w.r.t.
 the alanine does not change significantly as afunction of time (within the statistical error). Plot (b) of
Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp7a} presents the number of hydrogen bonds between the
alanine and water molecules, and between two water molecules. We see that the
number hydrogen bonds remains almost the as the EF is turned on,
although molecular dipoles tend to align with the direction of the EF (result
not shown). 
The EF-induced solvent effect on the alanine is also counted by calculating the
difference of the water-alanine electrostatic interaction 
between systems without and with the EF.
The energy difference is found to be $-19.1$~~kJ/mol that is
comparable to the electrostatic energy associated to the dipole of the alanine itself.
Therefore, we conclude that the solvation structure around the
alanine does not change significantly or contribute significantly in determining the conformational dynamics of the alanine under the action of EF.






\subsection{The finite-size effect of the Hamiltonian dynamics and thermostated regions}

\begin{figure}
  \centering

  \caption{Testing the finite-size effect of the Hamiltonian dynamics and thermostated region.

  }
  \label{fig:tmp7}
\end{figure}

Just as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:tmp2b}, we perform nonequilibrium MD
simulations in a finite size periodic system, and further divided it
into a Hamiltonian dynamics region and a thermostated region.
Since the periodic boundary conditions and the division of the system
are technical (not physical) approximations to the real system with dynamics-preserveing thermal control, 
the effect of the finite-size in 
the system settings should be carefully checked.
Therefore, we
perform two additional simulations: one with box dimension $L=4.0$~nm (box size on all directions are the same) and a
Hamiltonian dynamics region of radius $R_{ex} = 1.0$~nm. A second simulation is done with box size $L=4.0$~nm and a Hamiltonian dynamics region of
radius $R_{ex} = 1.5$~nm. We compare the results of these two simulations to those of the system we have used so far, i.e. $L=2.7$~nm and $R_{ex} = 1.0$~nm.
Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp7} presents a satisfactory consistency in
the simulation results of the three systems, which implies that the finite-size effects are
actually negligible.



\section{Example II:
  periodically oscillatory EF}

A step forward in our study is to consider a periodically oscillatory EF which has
a $\sin$-wave shape:
\begin{align}
  \vect E(t) = (E_0\sin(2\pi \omega t), 0, 0)
\end{align}
where $E_0$ is the intensity of the field, which is chosen to be
1.0~V/nm.  $\omega$ is the oscillating frequency, which is related to
the period $T$ by $\omega = 1/T$.  Here we tested three different
values of $T$: 10, 40 and 200, which correspond
to frequency of 100, 25 and 5~GHz, respectively.
% The periods of the later two are
% commensurate to the time scales discovered by the nonequilibrium MD
% simulation of constant EF. The first is to test the if the
% period is further reduced to smaller than 20~ps, there is any other
% timescale of interest would play a role. Although the periods are
% chosen according to the discovered time scales in the constant
% EF simulation, the nonequilibrium phenonema of oscillating
% EF cannot be derived from the constant field system.
% As far as the EF changes, the internal time scale of the
% system also changes, therefore, the nonequilibrium probabilities is a
% complicated interplay of different internal time scales under
% different EF.
% We do not try to theoretically predict
% what will happen under the oscillating EF by a series constant EF simulation
% revealing the internal dynamics under different strength of EF, but just directly
% do the nonequilibrium MD simulation for the oscillating EF, and discuss
% the observed phenonema.

    10~ps, while the green line is for a period of 40~ps and the blue for 200~ps.}
  \label{fig:tmp8}
\end{figure}


Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp8} (a)
presents the $x$-component of the molecular dipole moment as
a function of time. The red, green and blue lines report the
results of $T=10$~ps, 40~ps and 200~ps, respectively. The black line
shows the dipole moment under constant EF
for reference.
It shows that the oscillating period of the molecular dipole moment
is the same as the period of the oscillatory EF. Therefore,
the molecular dipole moment
is able to respond to the external EF almost immediately.
At $T=200$~ps, the maximum magnitude of the molecular
dipole moment is close to the values obtained in the case of constant EF, which
means that the variation of the oscillatory EF is so slow that the
alanine has enough time to 
relax its dipole. However,
for $T=10$ and 40~ps, the EF oscillates faster,
and although the alanine dipeptide can respond to the EF action immediately,
it does not have enough time to fully relax the dipole, as aconsequence the maximum dipole moment is smaller than the previous case.
% For even smaller period $T=10$~ps, the alanine does not have enough
% time  to properly align the molecular dipole according to the external
% field, so we see the maximum dipole moment is only about one third of the
% constant EF case.
Plot (b) of Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp9} presents the orientational order
parameter. The notations are the same as in plot (a).
% From the constant
% EF simulation, we see that the response of order parameter has
% two time scales: In the fast time scale, the 
For all cases the order parameter is much
smaller than in the case of constant EF. One possible reason is that the
relaxation of the order parameter is very slow, and the molecule in case of oscillatory field is
not exposed to a strong enough EF for a long enough. For  $T=10$ and 40~ps, the orientation of the alanine is only weakly
parallel to the EF. It is worth to notice that for the case of constant EF,
we also observe a quick alignment of molecular orientation to the EF
on the time scale of 10~ps. For $T=200$~ps, The molecule periodically
becomes perpendicular to the EF, but this directional preference is much
weaker than the case of constant EF.

For all periods investigated,
the observed time-dependent probabilities  in $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1$ and $B_2$ are
highly oscillating and the average value does not change
considerably with respect to time.
However, the probability in conformation $C$ significantly
increases to approximately 0.17 for $T=10$~ps, 0.27 for  $T=40$~ps, and
0.25 for $T=200$~ps.

% Note that in the case of constant EF, although the dipole moment is
% larger than the  $T=40$~ps case (see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp8} for comparison), the

% {\bf END COMMENT}\\
For the case of constant EF, the probability of conformation $A_1$
increases from 0.45 to 0.69, and that of $B_1$ almost vanishes.
These phenomena are not observed in the oscillatory EF case.
In the case of $T=10$ and $40$~ps, the probability of being of a conformation
reaches the steady value in around 300~ps, while it requires about 1200~ps
for the $T=200$~ps case. 
%This suggest that
%the intrinsic time scales of the nonequilibrium processes are commensurate
%for $T=10$ and $40$~ps, while they are much longer for $T=200$~ps.

Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp10} shows increasing
integrated probability net fluxes, which imply some lasting and directional
fluxes among the conformations (see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp11} for a schematic plot of the main probability
fluxes for $T=10$~ps).
The thickness of the arrows and the numbers nearby indicates
the average amount of the net fluxes.
This shows an interesting phenomenon: although
the oscillatory EF is not directional and vanishes in a time-average process,
it generates directional probability fluxes among the conformations.
Moreover, we have identified some loops of the flux: for example, $A_1 \rightarrow B_1
\rightarrow B_2 \rightarrow A_2 \rightarrow A_1$, $A_1 \rightarrow B_1
\rightarrow B_2 \rightarrow A_1$,  $A_1 \rightarrow B_1
\rightarrow B_2 \rightarrow C \rightarrow A_1$ and $B_1
\rightarrow B_2 \rightarrow C \rightarrow B_1$.
The probability flux of $T=40$~ps is quantitatively
comparable to case $T=10$~ps, except that the probability fluxes
going into conformation $C$ is stronger, which actually results in
a more dominant probability in $C$.
The probability flux of case $T=200$~ps is qualitatively
similar to $T=10$~ps and $T=40$~ps, however,
the amount is much lower than the latter two cases.
Moreover, we see that the integrated flux reaches a linearly increasing
stage after about 3200~ps, which is even longer than the time scale
at which the probability of $C$ reaches its steady value. This indicates
a longer intrinsic time scale in the $T=200$~ps case.

We have not studied periods longer than $T=200$~ps, because
from the trend suggests that a longer period indicates even longer intrinsic time scales.
This would require massive computational efforts not strictly required at this stage.
However, the long-period-limit case can be safely guessed: When
the EF changes so slow that at each time the system
can be viewed as in equilibrium, then the process is a quasi-equilibrium
process, and nonequilibrium phenomenon will not be observed. For example,
the probability being of a conformation will change
smoothly from equilibrium value to the new equilibrium of $E=1$~V/nm, as
the EF increases.
And then smoothly goes back to equilibrium, as the EF vanishes.
the time-averaged net flux will be infinitely small,
and the integrated flux will be periodical, and constant in time-average.


% similar to $T=10$~ps. For $T=40$~ps, the probability
% flux is quantiatively comparable to the case $T=10$~ps, while
% the strength of fluxex for $T=200$~ps is much weaker.

% The time needed to reach a steady state is
% roughly 400~ps that is the same as the

% When the period is $T=200$~ps, the phenonema are substentially different

% Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp10} suggests an even long time scale, but we cannot draw

% due to the lack of computational power to perform even longer simulations. 
% The steady probability of being in state $C$ is roughly the same as the

% scale in the system, comparing with the static EF case, in which all time scales
% are actually decided by the \emph{static} external field. We also observe
% a suden change in the probability flux from state $A_2$ to $A_1$ at
% around 1600~ps, which may imply a \emph{dynamically} rare event.
% Since we do not have the computer power to perform even longer simulations,

\section{Conclusions and discussions}

In this paper, we investigate the nonequilibrium conformational
dynamics of alanine dipeptide under constant and oscillatory electric
field (EF) by the dynamical nonequilibrium molecule dynamics (D-NEMD) method.
The conformations of the alanine dipeptide are
firstly projected onto the Ramachandran histogram, and
then manually grouped into 5 ranges of conformations.
% several conformations are identified by a manual
% division of the Ramachandran histogram.
These ranges of conformations
correspond to different secondary structures of protein.
Then the time-dependent probability
of being in a certain conformation range and the net probability flux
between them are calculated. 
We conclude that under the constant EF, several different time scales
of the conformational dynamics are identified. The slowest time scales,
which are as long as 500~ps, correspond to a conformational change
from $B_1$ (corresponds to $\beta$-sheet) to $A_1$ and $C$ (right-handed
and left handed $\alpha$-helix, respectively).
Under the constant EF, the dipole moment of alanine aligns parallel to the direction
of the EF, while the direction of the molecule lies perpendicular to the
EF. Moreover, the dipole moment response of the alanine is
demonstrated to be much faster than the orientational response.
The solvation structure around the alanine is investigated
by calculating the solute-solvent radial distribution function and the average number of hydrogen
bond, and is proved to be preserved as the EF turns on, though the
dipole moment of both solute and solvation, at the same time, align with the direction of EF.
We consider three oscillatory EF cases with different frequency:
5, 25 and 100~GHz, respectively. The
probability of conformations are observed to be also oscillatory,
and the frequency of this oscillation is the same as the external EF.
After long enough time,
the system reaches a ``steady state'', and the probabilities oscillate only around
a time-independent value at the long time scale. Notice that this is not a really ``steady state'' as defined by
the literature~\cite{seifert2010fluctuation}, because at the
short time scale, the probabilities are still oscillating.
% they oscillate only around a time-invariant value,
% so we say the system reaches a steady state.
Although the time-averaged EF vanishes, the probabilities of the conformations
are as a matter of fact changes due to the oscillatory EF. The most impressive phenomenon
is the increasing of conformation $C$ that corresponds to
the left-handed $\alpha$-helix.
The slowest time scale of 25 and 100~GHz systems is about 300~ps, while
that of the 5~GHz system is significantly higher: 1200~ps.
We further update the last number to 3200~ps by analyzing the net probability flux.
% We further present a updated slowest time scale of the  5~GHz system
% to 3200~ps from the net probability flux.
In comparison with the periods of the EF, these time scales are much
slower, which indicate a very strong time scale separation
in these nonequilibrium conformation dynamics.
Although the time-average of the oscillatory EF vanishes, we observed a
\emph{directional} net probability flux between the conformations, and several
loop structures are observed. This result is unexpected and shed
light on the phenomenon of nonequilibrium conformational circulations driven
by oscillatory EF.

To eliminate the thermal effect in the nonequilibrium process, 
we propose  a nonequilibrium
temperature control method, by which the Hamiltonian dynamics is kept
around the molecule of interest, while the solvent far from the
molecule is thermostated. We prove the effectiveness of this
temperature control technique for nonequilibrium MD by testing
the finite size effect of the Hamiltonian dynamics region and the
thermostated region.

The intensity of the EF used in this paper is 1~V/nm for both constant
and oscillatory cases. This intensity is 4-5 orders of magnitude
higher than that reachable in a standard laboratory microwave
instrument~\cite{damm2012can}. However, this intensity is achievable
by a sharp electric field emitter tip~\cite{scovell2000phase}, near
the surface of mica~\cite{starzyk2013proteins}, or by a modern laser
equipment~\cite{vogel2008femtosecond}. The authors are fully aware
that the EF investigated in the present paper is idealized, as pointed
out by previous simulation studies~\cite{budi2005electric,
  budi2007effect, budi2008comparative, toschi2008effects,
  astrakas2011electric, astrakas2012structural, damm2012can,
  starzyk2013proteins, english2009nonequilibrium,
  solomentsev2012effects}. However, the present work presents a way of
studying the EF induced conformational dynamics, and opens the
possibility of conformational manipulation of the protein by applying
an external EF.

To describe the system, we use a classical force field with TIP3P water model.
The EF is well know to be able to protonate the water molecule at the
intensity we used in the paper. However, this happens at the time
scale of femitonsecond, which is much shorter than the slowest time
scale revolved by the current research, so on average it should not play an essential role on the conformational dynamics.
The polarization with respect to the external EF also does
not play a important role, because  under the EF of 1~V/nm, the induced dipole
of water is only c.a. 0.05~Debye that is negligible comparing with the
dipole moment response observed in our simulations.  Therefore, it is
reasonable to use a non-polarizable model in this study.  The reason we
prefer a rigid water model is that it is computationally more
efficient than any polarizable water model.  We also want to remind
the reader that it has been reported recently the speed of the slowest 
dynamics differs a lot among the different force
fields~\cite{vitalini2013speed}, but the qualitative conclusion (for
example what is the slowest and the second slowest process, from which
conformation to which) are basically consistent for the alanine.
Although our results are derived based on the CHARMM27 force field,
they still provides qualitative information on the dynamical response of the
alanine's conformation to the external EF.

\subsection{Electric field, force field, polarization and quantum effects}
\subsection{Conceptual comparison with other non equilibrium approaches}



% Clearly two time-scales of relaxation are observed.  For
% configurations $A_2$ and $B_2$, the relaxations are very fast and
% comparable to $t_{\textrm{warm}}$. For configurations $A_1$, $B_1$ and
% $C$, the time-scales of relaxation are roughly 600~\textsf{ps}.

% \section{Testing the effect of the thermostat and barostat}

% % \section{System set up}

% % $R_{\textrm{ex}}$ was chosen to be
% % $1.0$~\textsf{nm}, which means that a Langvin thermostat ($\tau =
% % 0.1~\textsf{ps}$) was applied to water molecules that were more than
% % $1.0$~\textsf{nm} away from the center of the simulation box. In
% % addition, a Parrinello-Rahman barostat was couple to the system with a
% % time-scale of $\tau_{\textrm{P}} = 2.0~\textsf{ps}$. 


% Let's consider an infinitely large NVE system (here we call it
% "universe"). Some interesting process is happening in a small
% subsystem. For equilibrium phenomena, this subsystem is the usually
% considered as NVT (or NPT, $\mu$VT, depends on how the question is
% raised) system.  In simulations, we only simulate the subsystem and
% use the thermostat to mimic the embedment into the universe.  For
% non-equilibrium simulation, we also want to simulate only the
% subsystem of interest, but the physical meaning of directly applying a
% thermostat designed for generating equilibrium ensemble is not clear
% to a non-equilibrium process. Moreover, there is no unique way of
% defining how the subsystem is coupled into the universe: It is subject
% to how the perturbation comes into the subsystem, and how the energy
% of the system dissipates into the universe. In the case of switching on
% EF system, two limiting scenarios are considered by us: (1)
% The subsystem is isolated from the universe: The EF is
% applied to a system that conserves the energy, volume and number of
% particle (i.e. a NVE subsystem in short).  The isolation here means
% that the subsystem does not exchange energy, volume and number of
% particle with the universe, but the perturbation (electric field) does
% come in to the subsystem.  The periodic boundary condition is applied
% here only to avoid the difficulty of defining a experimental
% meaningful boundary in simulation.  In this scenario, the size the
% subsystem is somewhat arbitrary (it depends on experimental setting),
% therefore, it is important to consider the convergence of the
% simulation result with respect to the size of the subregion.  (2) The
% system exchange the energy, volume and particle with the universe, and
% the universe is so big that the perturbation in the subsystem will not
% kick the universe from equilibrium.  In practice, it is impossible to
% simulate the infinite large universe, Instead, we want to simulate the
% considerably smaller subsystem instead.  The idea is to divide the
% simulation region into two parts (see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp2}): the first
% is called \emph{Newtonian dynamics region} that is a region around the
% molecule of interest, where the dynamics is Newtonian. Note that the
% molecular trajectories in the Newtonian dynamics region are the same
% as if it were couple to the universe, only when a proper boundary
% condition is provided. Strictly speaking, the boundary should be
% provided by the out side infinitely large universe, which immediately
% leads back to the numerical difficulty of simulating a infinite large
% system. However, we notice that the detailed information
% (i.e. position and velocity) of the every molecule outside the
% Newtonian dynamics region is not relevant to the non-equilibrium
% behavior of the molecule of interest, because we are only interest in
% the non-equilibrium averages, which does not depends on the individual
% trajectory, but on the trajectorial ensemble sampled by the
% non-equilibrium simulation.  Therefore, the universe, as a boundary to
% the Newtonian dynamics region, can be replace by
% an efficiently thermo- and barostated subsystem, as indicated by the gray
% part of Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp2}. 
% % That is to say the subsystem is coupled to a
% % thermostat, a barostat and a particle bath with infinitely high
% % efficiency. Practically, it is impossible to simulation with a
% % ``infinitely fast'' thermostat, barostat and particle bath.
% We indicate the radius of the Newtonian dynamics region by
% $R_{\textrm{ex}} = 1~\textsf{nm}$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp2} for
% explanation), and couple it to very sufficient thermo- and
% barostat. We use a Langevin thermostat coupled to the thermostated
% region with a time-scale of $\tau_{T} = 0.1~\textsf{ps}$, and a
% Parrinello-Rahman barostat with a time-scale of $\tau_{P} =
% 2.0~\textsf{ps}$.

% The non-equilibrium steady temperature and pressure of the
% non-thermostated simulation are $330$ K and $-500$ Bar,
% correspondingly. Those of the thermostated system are $300$ K and 1
% Bar, correspondingly. Therefore, we can see from Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp6}
% that the relaxation of the thermostated system is faster than the
% non-thermostated system. The three time-scale of metastable population
% dynamics in the thermostated system is consistent with that of the
% non-thermostated system. This means that thermostating, in this case,
% does not qualitatively change the population dynamics of metastable
% states.

% % To make the non-equilibrium feasible, we assume the
% % non-equilibrium process is \emph{local}, i.e. the non-equilibrium perturbation
% % of the system happens only locally, and the rest of the system
% % stays the unperturbed (usually assumed under ambient conditions).
% % This provides us the possibility of simulating only the small subsystem
% % of the universe: We can simulate only subsystem by providing proper
% % boundary condition for it, so that it behaves as if it were embeded into
% % the universe.

% % \subsection{The water structure around methane under impluse }
% % In this study, we firstly consider the system of a methane molecule solvated
% % in the liquid water environment. A local density perturbation is implemented
% % by applying an impluse  in a shell surronding methane, see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp1}.
% % % As far as we concerned, the situation is: we truncate the universe to the
% % % subsystem, and provide proper boundary condition for this
% % % subsystem.
% % Here we denote the size of this subsystem by $R_{\ex}$.
% % Notice this subsystem is simulated by the Newtonian
% % dynamics. If the size of the
% % subsystem is large enough so that the perturbation is
% % small enough when it travels to the boundary of the subsystem, then a
% % trivial boundary condition would be: coupling the system to a boundary
% % layer equilibriated by the thermostat (and barostat or particle reservior),
% % which mimics the infinitely large equilibrium universe.
